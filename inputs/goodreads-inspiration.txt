Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.

You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching,
Love like you'll never be hurt,
Sing like there's nobody listening,
And live like it's heaven on earth.

Be the change that you wish to see in the world.

No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.

Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.

Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.

Without music, life would be a mistake.

We accept the love we think we deserve.

Imperfection is beauty, madness is genius and it's better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring.

There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.

We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.

Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, today is a gift of God, which is why we call it the present.

Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.

I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.

The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference.

I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.

You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. And YOU are the one who'll decide where to go...

This life is what you make it. No matter what, you're going to mess up sometimes, it's a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how you're going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.

It is never too late to be what you might have been.

There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.

Everything you can imagine is real.

You can never get a cup of tea large enough or a book long enough to suit me.

To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.

Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.

Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.

Listen to the mustn'ts, child. Listen to the don'ts. Listen to the shouldn'ts, the impossibles, the won'ts. Listen to the never haves, then listen close to me... Anything can happen, child. Anything can be.

When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us.

Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.

So, this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.

You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. I hope someday you'll join us. And the world will live as one.

Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.

You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching,
Love like you'll never be hurt,
Sing like there's nobody listening,
And live like it's heaven on earth.

Be the change that you wish to see in the world.

And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.

Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.

Itâs no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.

What you're supposed to do when you don't like a thing is change it. If you can't change it, change the way you think about it. Don't complain.

A person's a person, no matter how small.

Heâs not perfect. You arenât either, and the two of you will never be perfect. But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can. He isnât going to quote poetry, heâs not thinking about you every moment, but he will give you a part of him that he knows you could break. Donât hurt him, donât change him, and donât expect for more than he can give. Donât analyze. Smile when he makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him when heâs not there. Love hard when there is love to be had. Because perfect guys donât exist, but thereâs always one guy that is perfect for you.

It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.

When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives mean the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand. The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate not knowing, not curing, not healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness, that is a friend who cares.

You can't live your life for other people. You've got to do what's right for you, even if it hurts some people you love.

Well-behaved women seldom make history.

Nothing is impossible, the word itself says 'I'm possible'!

When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love have always won. There have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time, they can seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall. Think of it--always.

I can't give you a sure-fire formula for success, but I can give you a formula for failure: try to please everybody all the time.

Do what you feel in your heart to be right â for youâll be criticized anyway.

[...]the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes âAwww!

Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.

So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.

Peace begins with a smile..

Imagining the future is a kind of nostalgia. (...) You spend your whole life stuck in the labyrinth, thinking about how you'll escape it one day, and how awesome it will be, and imagining that future keeps you going, but you never do it. You just use the future to escape the present.

For attractive lips, speak words of kindness.
For lovely eyes, seek out the good in people.
For a slim figure, share your food with the hungry.
For beautiful hair, let a child run his fingers through it once a day.
For poise, walk with the knowledge youâll never walk alone.
...
We leave you a tradition with a future.
The tender loving care of human beings will never become obsolete.
People even more than things have to be restored, renewed, revived, reclaimed and redeemed and redeemed and redeemed.
Never throw out anybody.
Remember, if you ever need a helping hand, youâll find one at the end of your arm.
As you grow older, you will discover that you have two hands: one for helping yourself, the other for helping others.
Your âgood old daysâ are still ahead of you, may you have many of them.

Do not read, as children do, to amuse yourself, or like the ambitious, for the purpose of instruction. No, read in order to live.

What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.

Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed, citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.

First they ignore you. Then they ridicule you. And then they attack you and want to burn you. And then they build monuments to you.

Whatever you are, be a good one.

Two wrongs don't make a right, but they make a good excuse.

Promise Yourself
To be so strong that nothing
can disturb your peace of mind.
To talk health, happiness, and prosperity
to every person you meet.
To make all your friends feel
that there is something in them
To look at the sunny side of everything
and make your optimism come true.
To think only the best, to work only for the best,
and to expect only the best.
To be just as enthusiastic about the success of others
as you are about your own.
To forget the mistakes of the past
and press on to the greater achievements of the future.
To wear a cheerful countenance at all times
and give every living creature you meet a smile.
To give so much time to the improvement of yourself
that you have no time to criticize others.
To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear,
and too happy to permit the presence of trouble.
To think well of yourself and to proclaim this fact to the world,
not in loud words but great deeds.
To live in faith that the whole world is on your side
so long as you are true to the best that is in you.

Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art.... It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival.

I hope she'll be a fool -- that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.

I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge. That myth is more potent than history. That dreams are more powerful than facts. That hope always triumphs over experience. That laughter is the only cure for grief. And I believe that love is stronger than death.

May you live every day of your life.

You can't stay in your corner of the Forest waiting for others to come to you. You have to go to them sometimes.

Isn't it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no mistakes in it yet?

If my life is going to mean anything, I have to live it myself.

You can talk with someone for years, everyday, and still, it won't mean as much as what you can have when you sit in front of someone, not saying a word, yet you feel that person with your heart, you feel like you have known the person for forever.... connections are made with the heart, not the tongue.

When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down âhappyâ. They told me I didnât understand the assignment, and I told them they didnât understand life.

Hope is the thing with feathers 
That perches in the soul 
And sings the tune without the words 
And never stops at all.

Always do what you are afraid to do.

Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.

Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.

There is neither happiness nor misery in the world; there is only the comparison of one state with another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness. We must have felt what it is to die, Morrel, that we may appreciate the enjoyments of life. 
" Live, then, and be happy, beloved children of my heart, and never forget, that until the day God will deign to reveal the future to man, all human wisdom is contained in these two words, 'Wait and Hope.

Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark in the hopeless swamps of the not-quite, the not-yet, and the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish in lonely frustration for the life you deserved and have never been able to reach. The world you desire can be won. It exists.. it is real.. it is possible.. it's yours.

In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.

It is so hard to leaveâuntil you leave. And then it is the easiest goddamned thing in the world.

Talent hits a target no one else can hit. Genius hits a target no one else can see.

If you're reading this...
Congratulations, you're alive.
If that's not something to smile about,
then I don't know what is.

Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.

The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven..

Waiting is painful. Forgetting is painful. But not knowing which to do is the worst kind of suffering.

Fantasy is hardly an escape from reality. It's a way of understanding it.

I can be changed by what happens to me. But I refuse to be reduced by it.
(Popular misquote of "You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.")

Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.

And once the storm is over, you wonât remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You wonât even be sure, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you wonât be the same person who walked in. Thatâs what this stormâs all about.

If you can't fly then run, if you can't run then walk, if you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.

The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater.

I love to see a young girl go out and grab the world by the lapels. Life's a bitch. You've got to go out and kick ass.

When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.

Turn your wounds into wisdom.

Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what is right.

Hell is empty and all the devils are here.

And, in the end
The love you take
is equal to the love you make.

What I need is the dandelion in the spring. The bright yellow that means rebirth instead of destruction. The promise that life can go on, no matter how bad our losses. That it can be good again.

Prayer is not asking. It is a longing of the soul. It is daily admission of one's weakness. It is better in prayer to have a heart without words than words without a heart.

I am not sure exactly what heaven will be like, but I know that when we die and it comes time for God to judge us, he will not ask, 'How many good things have you done in your life?' rather he will ask, 'How much love did you put into what you did?

The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.

It isn't what you have or who you are or where you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it.

I like living. I have sometimes been wildly, despairingly, acutely miserable, racked with sorrow; but through it all I still know quite certainly that just to be alive is a grand thing.

War is peace. 
Freedom is slavery. 
Ignorance is strength.

It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

If you remember me, then I don't care if everyone else forgets.

I don't trust people who don't love themselves and tell me, 'I love you.' ... There is an African saying which is: Be careful when a naked person offers you a shirt.

Weâre all seeking that special person who is right for us. But if youâve been through enough relationships, you begin to suspect thereâs no right person, just different flavors of wrong. Why is this? Because you yourself are wrong in some way, and you seek out partners who are wrong in some complementary way. But it takes a lot of living to grow fully into your own wrongness. And it isnât until you finally run up against your deepest demons, your unsolvable problemsâthe ones that make you truly who you areâthat weâre ready to find a lifelong mate. Only then do you finally know what youâre looking for. Youâre looking for the wrong person. But not just any wrong person: it's got to be the right wrong personâsomeone you lovingly gaze upon and think, âThis is the problem I want to have.â
I will find that special person who is wrong for me in just the right way.

None but ourselves can free our minds.

Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.

Only in the darkness can you see the stars.

Sometimes our light goes out, but is blown again into instant flame by an encounter with another human being.

I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it.

A woman's heart should be so hidden in God that a man has to seek Him just to find her.

It's kind of fun to do the impossible.

When I was a little girl I used to read fairy tales. In fairy tales you meet Prince Charming and he's everything you ever wanted. In fairy tales the bad guy is very easy to spot. The bad guy is always wearing a black cape so you always know who he is. Then you grow up and you realize that Prince Charming is not as easy to find as you thought. You realize the bad guy is not wearing a black cape and he's not easy to spot; he's really funny, and he makes you laugh, and he has perfect hair.

A painter should begin every canvas with a wash of black, because all things in nature are dark except where exposed by the light.

Pain is temporary. Quitting lasts forever.

Clouds come floating into my life, no longer to carry rain or usher storm, but to add color to my sunset sky.

Simplicity, patience, compassion.
These three are your greatest treasures.
Simple in actions and thoughts, you return to the source of being.
Patient with both friends and enemies,
you accord with the way things are.
Compassionate toward yourself,
you reconcile all beings in the world.

The truth is, unless you let go, unless you forgive yourself, unless you forgive the situation, unless you realize that the situation is over, you cannot move forward.

Stories never really end...even if the books like to pretend they do. Stories always go on. They don't end on the last page, any more than they begin on the first page.

The things you do for yourself are gone when you are gone, but the things you do for others remain as your legacy.

The Chinese use two brush strokes to write the word 'crisis.' One brush stroke stands for danger; the other for opportunity. In a crisis, be aware of the danger--but recognize the opportunity.

I was smiling yesterday,I am smiling today and I will smile tomorrow.Simply because life is too short to cry for anything.

People say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day.

The most important kind of freedom is to be what you really are. You trade in your reality for a role. You trade in your sense for an act. You give up your ability to feel, and in exchange, put on a mask. There can't be any large-scale revolution until there's a personal revolution, on an individual level. It's got to happen inside first.

All the darkness in the world cannot extinguish the light of a single candle.

You never fail until you stop trying.

Start writing, no matter what. The water does not flow until the faucet is turned on.

If you want to forget something or someone, never hate it, or never hate him/her. Everything and everyone that you hate is engraved upon your heart; if you want to let go of something, if you want to forget, you cannot hate.

Dare to Be
When a new day begins, dare to smile gratefully.
When there is darkness, dare to be the first to shine a light.
When there is injustice, dare to be the first to condemn it.
When something seems difficult, dare to do it anyway.
When life seems to beat you down, dare to fight back.
When there seems to be no hope, dare to find some.
When youâre feeling tired, dare to keep going.
When times are tough, dare to be tougher.
When love hurts you, dare to love again.
When someone is hurting, dare to help them heal.
When another is lost, dare to help them find the way.
When a friend falls, dare to be the first to extend a hand.
When you cross paths with another, dare to make them smile.
When you feel great, dare to help someone else feel great too.
When the day has ended, dare to feel as youâve done your best.
Dare to be the best you can â
At all times, Dare to be!

You're off to Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting,
So... get on your way!

Why didn't I learn to treat everything like it was the last time. My greatest regret was how much I believed in the future.

The secret of health for both mind and body is not to mourn for the past, nor to worry about the future, but to live the present moment wisely and earnestly.

Don't be afraid of your fears. They're not there to scare you. They're there to let you know that something is worth it.

Don't say you don't have enough time. You have exactly the same number of hours per day that were given to Helen Keller, Pasteur, Michaelangelo, Mother Teresa, Leonardo da Vinci, Thomas Jefferson, and Albert Einstein.

Hope
Smiles from the threshold of the year to come, 
Whispering 'it will be happier'...

One love, one heart, one destiny.

To see a World in a Grain of Sand 
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower, 
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand 
And Eternity in an hour.

It's not the face, but the expressions on it. It's not the voice, but what you say. It's not how you look in that body, but the thing you do with it. You are beautiful.

Well, now
If little by little you stop loving me
I shall stop loving you
Little by little
If suddenly you forget me
Do not look for me
For I shall already have forgotten you
If you think it long and mad the wind of banners that passes through my life
And you decide to leave me at the shore of the heart where I have roots
Remember
That on that day, at that hour, I shall lift my arms
And my roots will set off to seek another land

Is 'fat' really the worst thing a human being can be? Is 'fat' worse than 'vindictive', 'jealous', 'shallow', 'vain', 'boring' or 'cruel'? Not to me.

Once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward, for there you have been, and there you will always long to return.

The thing about growing up with Fred and George," said Ginny thoughtfully, "is that you sort of start thinking anything's possible if you've got enough nerve.

So be sure when you step, Step with care and great tact. And remember that life's A Great Balancing Act. And will you succeed? Yes! You will, indeed! (98 and Â¾ percent guaranteed) Kid, you'll move mountains.

To me, Fearless is not the absense of fear. It's not being completely unafraid. To me, Fearless is having fears. Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, Fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death.

If she's amazing, she won't be easy. If she's easy, she won't be amazing. If she's worth it, you wont give up. If you give up, you're not worthy. ... Truth is, everybody is going to hurt you; you just gotta find the ones worth suffering for.

We have to allow ourselves to be loved by the people who really love us, the people who really matter. Too much of the time, we are blinded by our own pursuits of people to love us, people that don't even matter, while all that time we waste and the people who do love us have to stand on the sidewalk and watch us beg in the streets! It's time to put an end to this. It's time for us to let ourselves be loved.

You see things; you say, 'Why?' But I dream things that never were; and I say 'Why not?

You is kind. You is smart. You is important.

Any fool can be happy. It takes a man with real heart to make beauty out of the stuff that makes us weep.

Live in the present, remember the past, and fear not the future, for it doesn't exist and never shall. There is only now.

Dance, when you're broken open. Dance, if you've torn the bandage off. Dance in the middle of the fighting. Dance in your blood. Dance when you're perfectly free.

If you are irritated by every rub, how will your mirror be polished?

It doesn't interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for, and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart's longing.
It doesn't interest me how old you are. I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love, for your dream, for the adventure of being alive. 
It doesn't interest me what planets are squaring your moon. I want to know if you have touched the center of your own sorrow, if you have been opened by life's betrayals or have become shriveled and closed from fear of further pain!I want to know if you can sit with pain, mine or your own, without moving to hide it or fade it, or fix it. 
I want to know if you can be with joy, mine or your own, if you can dance with wildness and let the ecstasy fill you to the tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us to be careful, to be realistic, to remember the limitations of being human. 
It doesn't interest me if the story you are telling me is true. I want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself; if you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own soul; if you can be faithlessand therefore trustworthy. 
I want to know if you can see beauty even when it's not pretty, every day,and if you can source your own life from its presence. 
I want to know if you can live with failure, yours and mine, and still stand on the edge of the lake and shout to the silver of the full moon, âYes!â
It doesn't interest me to know where you live or how much money you have. I want to know if you can get up, after the night of grief and despair, weary and bruised to the bone, and do what needs to be done to feed the children. 
It doesn't interest me who you know or how you came to be here. I want to know if you will stand in the center of the fire with me and not shrink back. 
It doesn't interest me where or what or with whom you have studied. I want to know what sustains you, from the inside, when all else falls away. 
I want to know if you can be alone with yourself and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments.

You were born with wings, why prefer to crawl through life?

Better to be strong than pretty and useless.

âThough nobody can go back and make a new beginning... Anyone can start over and make a new ending.

What makes the desert beautiful,' said the little prince, 'is that somewhere it hides a well...

It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew - and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents - that there was all the difference in the world.

Understanding is the first step to acceptance, and only with acceptance can there be recovery.

âLife is a shipwreck, but we must not forget to sing in the lifeboats.

The unreal is more powerful than the real. Because nothing is as perfect as you can imagine it. Because its only intangible ideas, concepts, beliefs, fantasies that last. Stone crumbles. Wood rots. People, well, they die. But things as fragile as a thought, a dream, a legend, they can go on and on. If you can change the way people think. The way they see themselves. The way they see the world. You can change the way people live their lives. That's the only lasting thing you can create.

A ship is safe in harbor, but that's not what ships are for.

The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any.

Even if you are on the right track, youâll get run over if you just sit there.

We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special.

Maybe everyone can live beyond what they're capable of.

Happiness [is] only real when shared

You should never be surprised when someone treats you with respect, you should expect it.

May the forces of evil become confused on the way to your house.

The worst part of success is trying to find someone who is happy for you.

The past has no power over the present moment.

There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.

Letting go means to come to the realization that some people are a part of your history, but not a part of your destiny.

When people don't express themselves, they die one piece at a time.

What's the good of living if you don't try a few things?

The important thing to you is not how many years in your life, but how much life in your years!

I have come to accept the feeling of not knowing where I am going. And I have trained myself to love it. Because it is only when we are suspended in mid-air with no landing in sight, that we force our wings to unravel and alas begin our flight. And as we fly, we still may not know where we are going to. But the miracle is in the unfolding of the wings. You may not know where you're going, but you know that so long as you spread your wings, the winds will carry you.

Try a little harder to be a little better.

There was another life that I might have had, but I am having this one.

It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.

Reputation is what other people know about you. Honor is what you know about yourself.

Remember, darkness does not always equate to evil, just as light does not always bring good.

When I was about eight, I decided that the most wonderful thing, next to a human being, was a book.

No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn't know it.

Nothing in the world is ever completely wrong. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day.

I meant what I said and I said what I meant. An elephant's faithful one-hundred percent!

If you think you are too small to make a difference, try sleeping with a mosquito.

She seems so cool, so focused, so quiet, yet her eyes remain fixed upon the horizon. You think you know all there is to know about her immediately upon meeting her, but everything you think you know is wrong. Passion flows through her like a river of blood. 
She only looked away for a moment, and the mask slipped, and you fell. All your tomorrows start here.

If people refuse to look at you in a new light and they can only see you for what you were, only see you for the mistakes you've made, if they don't realize that you are not your mistakes, then they have to go.

The only way that we can live, is if we grow. The only way that we can grow is if we change. The only way that we can change is if we learn. The only way we can learn is if we are exposed. And the only way that we can become exposed is if we throw ourselves out into the open. Do it. Throw yourself.

The purpose of life is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience.

There must be those among whom we can sit down and weep and still be counted as warriors.

Go on with what your heart tells you, or you will lose all.

The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, they are felt with the heart.

Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see.

Anyone can hide. Facing up to things, working through them, that's what makes you strong.

Lack of direction, not lack of time, is the problem. We all have twenty-four hour days.

Change will not come if we wait for some other person, or if we wait for some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.

What do we live for, if it is not to make life less difficult for each other?

All parents damage their children. It cannot be helped. Youth, like pristine glass, absorbs the prints of its handlers. Some parents smudge, others crack, a few shatter childhoods completely into jagged little pieces, beyond repair.

When one tugs at a single thing in nature, he finds it attached to the rest of the world.

In the end
these things matter most:
How well did you love?
How fully did you live?
How deeply did you let go?

I kept always two books in my pocket, one to read, one to write in.

It's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog.

My concern is not whether God is on our side; my greatest concern is to be on God's side, for God is always right.

I will love you always. When this red hair is white, I will still love you. When the smooth softness of youth is replaced by the delicate softness of age, I will still want to touch your skin. When your face is full of the lines of every smile you have ever smiled, of every surprise I have seen flash through your eyes, when every tear you have ever cried has left its mark upon your face,I will treasure you all the more, because I was there to see it all. I will share your life with you, Meredith, and I will love you until the last breath leaves your body or mine.

A woman's heart should be so hidden in God that a man has to seek Him just to find her.

Great heroes need great sorrows and burdens, or half their greatness goes unnoticed. It is all part of the fairy tale.

It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.

please believe that things are good with me, and even when they're not, they will be soon enough. And i will always believe the same about you.

I'd rather be hated for who I am, than loved for who I am not.

The brick walls are there for a reason. The brick walls are not there to keep us out. The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something. Because the brick walls are there to stop the people who donât want it badly enough. Theyâre there to stop the other people.

Never be bullied into silence. Never allow yourself to be made a victim. Accept no one's definition of your life, but define yourself.

Tears are words that need to be written.

Every book, every volume you see here, has a soul. The soul of the person who wrote it and of those who read it and lived and dreamed with it. Every time a book changes hands, every time someone runs his eyes down its pages, its spirit grows and strengthens.

Trees that are slow to grow bear the best fruit.

Even strength must bow to wisdom sometimes.

Once you have read a book you care about, some part of it is always with you.

Life is too short to waste any amount of time on wondering what other people think about you. In the first place, if they had better things going on in their lives, they wouldn't have the time to sit around and talk about you. What's important to me is not others' opinions of me, but what's important to me is my opinion of myself.

I don't think of all the misery, but of the beauty that still remains.

What's terrible is to pretend that second-rate is first-rate. To pretend that you don't need love when you do; or you like your work when you know quite well you're capable of better.

So many people walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half-asleep, even when they're busy doing things they think are important. This is because they're chasing the wrong things. The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.

I wonder how many people don't get the one they want, but end up with the one they're supposed to be with.

Parents can only give good advice or put them on the right paths, but the final forming of a person's character lies in their own hands.

Attitude is a choice. Happiness is a choice. Optimism is a choice. Kindness is a choice. Giving is a choice. Respect is a choice. Whatever choice you make makes you. Choose wisely.

Iâve been fighting to be who I am all my life. Whatâs the point of being who I am, if I canât have the person who was worth all the fighting for?

If you want to be happy, do not dwell in the past, do not worry about the future, focus on living fully in the present.

I must be a mermaid, Rango. I have no fear of depths and a great fear of shallow living.

When things break, it's not the actual breaking that prevents them from getting back together again. It's because a little piece gets lost - the two remaining ends couldn't fit together even if they wanted to. The whole shape has changed.

I want to be in a relationship where you telling me you love me is just a ceremonious validation of what you already show me.

We donât need a list of rights and wrongs, tables of dos and donâts: we need books, time, and silence. 
 is soon forgotten, but 
 lasts forever.

Atticus, he was real nice."
"Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.

We are all different. Donât judge, understand instead.

The grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love, and something to hope for.

Do no harm and leave the world a better place than you found it.

Others have seen what is and asked why. I have seen what could be and asked why not. 

To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
To the last syllable of recorded time;
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
And then is heard no more. It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.

Only people who are capable of loving strongly can also suffer great sorrow, but this same necessity of loving serves to counteract their grief and heals them.

The question is not what you look at, but what you see.

I figured something out. The future is unpredictable.

Acts of Kindness:
A random act of kindness, no matter how small, can make a tremendous impact on someone else's life.

Believe in Your Heart
Believe in your heart that you're meant to live a life full of passion, purpose, magic and miracles.

Wanting to be someone else is a waste of the person you are.

However many holy words you read, however many you speak, what good will they do you if you do not act on upon them?

Don't let the bastards grind you down.

Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.

Incredible change happens in your life when you decide to take control of what you do have power over instead of craving control over what you don't.

Ask for what you want and be prepared to get it!

All thinking men are atheists.

If we listened to our intellect we'd never have a love affair. We'd never have a friendship. We'd never go in business because we'd be cynical: "It's gonna go wrong." Or "She's going to hurt me." Or,"I've had a couple of bad love affairs, so therefore . . ." Well, that's nonsense. You're going to miss life. You've got to jump off the cliff all the time and build your wings on the way down.

Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it.
Boldness has genius, power and magic in it!

A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life.

If I should have a daughterâ¦âInstead of âMomâ, sheâs gonna call me âPoint B.â Because that way, she knows that no matter what happens, at least she can always find her way to me. And Iâm going to paint the solar system on the back of her hands so that she has to learn the entire universe before she can say âOh, I know that like the back of my hand.â
Sheâs gonna learn that this life will hit you, hard, in the face, wait for you to get back up so it can kick you in the stomach. But getting the wind knocked out of you is the only way to remind your lungs how much they like the taste of air. There is hurt, here, that cannot be fixed by band-aids or poetry, so the first time she realizes that Wonder-woman isnât coming, Iâll make sure she knows she doesnât have to wear the cape all by herself. Because no matter how wide you stretch your fingers, your hands will always be too small to catch all the pain you want to heal. Believe me, Iâve tried.
And âBaby,â Iâll tell her âdonât keep your nose up in the air like that, I know that trick, youâre just smelling for smoke so you can follow the trail back to a burning house so you can find the boy who lost everything in the fire to see if you can save him. Or else, find the boy who lit the fire in the first place to see if you can change him.â
But I know that she will anyway, so instead Iâll always keep an extra supply of chocolate and rain boats nearby, âcause there is no heartbreak that chocolate canât fix. Okay, thereâs a few heartbreaks chocolate canât fix. But thatâs what the rain boots are for, because rain will wash away everything if you let it.
I want her to see the world through the underside of a glass bottom boat, to look through a magnifying glass at the galaxies that exist on the pin point of a human mind. Because thatâs how my mom taught me. That thereâll be days like this, âThereâll be days like this my momma saidâ when you open your hands to catch and wind up with only blisters and bruises. When you step out of the phone booth and try to fly and the very people you wanna save are the ones standing on your cape. When your boots will fill with rain and youâll be up to your knees in disappointment and those are the very days you have all the more reason to say âthank you,â âcause there is nothing more beautiful than the way the ocean refuses to stop kissing the shoreline no matter how many times itâs sent away.
You will put the âwindâ in win some lose some, you will put the âstarâ in starting over and over, and no matter how many land mines erupt in a minute be sure your mind lands on the beauty of this funny place called life.
And yes, on a scale from one to over-trusting I am pretty damn naive but I want her to know that this world is made out of sugar. It can crumble so easily but donât be afraid to stick your tongue out and taste it.
âBaby,â Iâll tell her âremember your mama is a worrier but your papa is a warrior and you are the girl with small hands and big eyes who never stops asking for more.â
Remember that good things come in threes and so do bad things and always apologize when youâve done something wrong but donât you ever apologize for the way your eyes refuse to stop shining.
Your voice is small but donât ever stop singing and when they finally hand you heartbreak, slip hatred and war under your doorstep and hand you hand-outs on street corners of cynicism and defeat, you tell them that they really ought to meet your mother.

Be steady and well-ordered in your life so that you can be fierce and original in your work.

Courage isn't having the strength to go on - it is going on when you don't have strength.

The starting point of all achievement is DESIRE. Keep this constantly in mind. Weak desire brings weak results, just as a small fire makes a small amount of heat.

. . . when it comes down to it, thatâs what life is all about: showing up for the people you love, again and again, until you canât show up anymore.

Keep your face always toward the sunshine - and shadows will fall behind you.

The unhappiest people in this world, are those who care the most about what other people think.

Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedomsâto choose oneâs attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose oneâs own way.

I am a part of all that I have met.

If you don't go after what you want, you'll never have it. If you don't ask, the answer is always no. If you don't step forward, you're always in the same place.

If you want to be happy, be.

Jane, be still; don't struggle so like a wild, frantic bird, that is rending its own plumage in its desperation."
"I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being, with an independent will; which I now exert to leave you.

There is nothing more dreadful than the habit of doubt. Doubt separates people. It is a poison that disintegrates friendships and breaks up pleasant relations. It is a thorn that irritates and hurts; it is a sword that kills.

If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other.

I just want you to know that youâre very specialâ¦ and the only reason Iâm telling you is that I donât know if anyone else ever has.

Iâve known people that the world has thrown everything at to discourage them...to break their spirit. And yet something about them retains a dignity. They face life and donât ask quarters.

We never know the quality of someone else's life, though we seldom resist the temptation to assume and pass judgement.

You never change your life until you step out of your comfort zone; change begins at the end of your comfort zone.

Take responsibility of your own happiness, never put it in other peopleâs hands.

Live the Life of Your Dreams: Be brave enough to live the life of your dreams according to your vision and purpose instead of the expectations and opinions of others.

I sought to hear the voice of God and climbed the topmost steeple, but God declared: "Go down again - I dwell among the people.

The desire to reach for the stars is ambitious. The desire to reach hearts is wise.

Whatever you do, you need courage. Whatever course you decide upon, there is always someone to tell you that you are wrong. There are always difficulties arising that tempt you to believe your critics are right. To map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires some of the same courage that a soldier needs. Peace has its victories, but it takes brave men and women to win them.

No matter how plain a woman may be, if truth and honesty are written across her face, she will be beautiful.

Stepping onto a brand-new path is difficult, but not more difficult than remaining in a situation, which is not nurturing to the whole woman.

A concept is a brick. It can be used to build a courthouse of reason. Or it can be thrown through the window.

I have never met a man so ignorant that I couldn't learn something from him.

It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.

there is a place in the heart that
will never be filled
a space
and even during the
best moments
and
the greatest times
times
we will know it
we will know it
more than
ever
there is a place in the heart that
will never be filled
and
we will wait
and
wait
in that space.

My only advice is to stay aware, listen carefully, and yell for help if you need it.

Respect other people's feelings. It might mean nothing to you, but it could mean everything to them.

Earth provides enough to satisfy every man's needs, but not every man's greed.

Life is too short to waste your time on people who donât respect, appreciate, and value you.

We're so self-important. So arrogant. Everybody's going to save something now. Save the trees, save the bees, save the whales, save the snails. And the supreme arrogance? Save the planet! Are these people kidding? Save the planet? We don't even know how to take care of ourselves; we haven't learned how to care for one another. We're gonna save the fuckin' planet? . . . And, by the way, there's nothing wrong with the planet in the first place. The planet is fine. The people are fucked! Compared with the people, the planet is doin' great. It's been here over four billion years . . . The planet isn't goin' anywhere, folks. We are! We're goin' away. Pack your shit, we're goin' away. And we won't leave much of a trace. Thank God for that. Nothing left. Maybe a little Styrofoam. The planet will be here, and we'll be gone. Another failed mutation; another closed-end biological mistake.

Two roads diverged in a wood, and I -
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.

No matter how your heart is grieving, if you keep on believing, the dreams that you wish will come true.

Pain is a pesky part of being human, I've learned it feels like a stab wound to the heart, something I wish we could all do without, in our lives here. Pain is a sudden hurt that can't be escaped. But then I have also learned that because of pain, I can feel the beauty, tenderness, and freedom of healing. Pain feels like a fast stab wound to the heart. But then healing feels like the wind against your face when you are spreading your wings and flying through the air! We may not have wings growing out of our backs, but healing is the closest thing that will give us that wind against our faces.

Instead of worrying about what you cannot control, shift your energy to what you can create.

The real heroes anyway aren't the people doing things; the real heroes are the people NOTICING things, paying attention.

Itâs only after youâve stepped outside your comfort zone that you begin to change, grow, and transform.

More smiling, less worrying. More compassion, less judgment. More blessed, less stressed. More love, less hate.

Just because you can doesn't mean you should.

I am not a teacher, but an awakener.

Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year.

You might as well answer the door, my child,
the truth is furiously knocking.

Be grateful for what you already have while you pursue your goals. 
If you arenât grateful for what you already have, what makes you think you would be happy with more.

No amount of regretting can change the past, and no amount of worrying can change the future.

Do what is right, not what is easy nor what is popular.

Life becomes easier and more beautiful when we can see the good in other people.

Don't let the expectations and opinions of other people affect your decisions. It's your life, not theirs. Do what matters most to you; do what makes you feel alive and happy. Don't let the expectations and ideas of others limit who you are. If you let others tell you who you are, you are living their reality â not yours. There is more to life than pleasing people. There is much more to life than following others' prescribed path. There is so much more to life than what you experience right now. You need to decide who you are for yourself. Become a whole being. Adventure.

Don't be pushed around by the fears in your mind. Be led by the dreams in your heart.

Happiness is not the absence of problems, it's the ability to deal with them.

Any book that helps a child to form a habit of reading, to make reading one of his deep and continuing needs, is good for him.

We are flawed creatures, all of us. Some of us think that means we should fix our flaws. But get rid of my flaws and there would be no one left.

Men are from Earth, women are from Earth. Deal with it.

Have courage for the great sorrows of life and patience for the small ones; and when you have laboriously accomplished your daily task, go to sleep in peace. God is awake.

Because paper has more patience than people. 

Love: a single word, a wispy thing, a word no bigger or longer than an edge. That's what it is: an edge; a razor. It draws up through the center of your life, cutting everything in two. Before and after. The rest of the world falls away on either side.

For me, I am driven by two main philosophies: know more today about the world than I knew yesterday and lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you.

Well, we all make mistakes, dear, so just put it behind you. We should regret our mistakes and learn from them, but never carry them forward into the future with us.

Because,' she said, 'when you're scared but you still do it anyway, 
 brave.

Sometimes life knocks you on your ass... get up, get up, get up!!! Happiness is not the absence of problems, it's the ability to deal with them.

Ladies and gentlemen of the class of '97:
Wear sunscreen.
If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. The long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience. I will dispense this advice now.
Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Oh, never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they've faded. But trust me, in 20 years, you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are not as fat as you imagine.
Don't worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the kind that blindside you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday.

Hearts are breakable," Isabelle said. "And I think even when you heal, you're never what you were before".

True love is not so much a matter of romance as it is a matter of anxious concern for the well-being of one's companion.

We don't make mistakes, just happy little accidents.

Be mindful. Be grateful. Be positive. Be true. Be kind.

You may tell a tale that takes up residence in someone's soul, becomes their blood and self and purpose. That tale will move them and drive them and who knows that they might do because of it, because of your words. That is your role, your gift.

Sometimes God allows what he hates to accomplish what he loves.

why are trying so hard to fit in, when you're born to stand out

The best thing to hold onto in life is each other.

There is a candle in your heart, ready to be kindled.
There is a void in your soul, ready to be filled.
You feel it, don't you?

To love and win is the best thing.
To love and lose, the next best.

A star falls from the sky and into your hands. Then it seeps through your veins and swims inside your blood and becomes every part of you. And then you have to put it back into the sky. And it's the most painful thing you'll ever have to do and that you've ever done. But what's yours is yours. Whether itâs up in the sky or here in your hands. And one day, it'll fall from the sky and hit you in the head real hard and that time, you won't have to put it back in the sky again.

The heart is the toughest part of the body. 
Tenderness is in the hands.

Donât waste your time in anger, regrets, worries, and grudges. Life is too short to be unhappy.

Success is not how high you have climbed, but how you make a positive difference to the world.

Help others without any reason and give without the expectation of receiving anything in return.

You are not rich until you have a rich heart.

Great things happen to those who don't stop believing, trying, learning, and being grateful.

Imagination is everything. It is the preview of life's coming attractions.

If you make a mistake and do not correct it, this is called a mistake.

Where there is ruin, there is hope for a treasure.

Dear God," she prayed, "let me be something every minute of every hour of my life. Let me be gay; let me be sad. Let me be cold; let me be warm. Let me be hungry...have too much to eat. Let me be ragged or well dressed. Let me be sincere - be deceitful. Let me be truthful; let me be a liar. Let me be honorable and let me sin. Only let me be something every blessed minute. And when I sleep, let me dream all the time so that not one little piece of living is ever lost.

Only after disaster can we be resurrected. It's only after you've lost everything that you're free to do anything. Nothing is static, everything is evolving, everything is falling apart.

A fight is going on inside me," said an old man to his son. "It is a terrible fight between two wolves. One wolf is evil. He is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego. The other wolf is good. he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith. The same fight is going on inside you." 
The son thought about it for a minute and then asked, "Which wolf will win?" 
The old man replied simply, "The one you feed.

Spoon feeding in the long run teaches us nothing but the shape of the spoon.

Follow your heart, listen to your inner voice, stop caring about what others think.

There is no good and evil, there is only power and those too weak to seek it.

Happiness is like a butterfly which, when pursued, is always beyond our grasp, but, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you.

When I let go of what I am, I become what I might be.

Shoot for the moon, even if you fail, you'll land among the stars

How would your life be different ifâ¦You stopped making negative judgmental assumptions about people you encounter? Let today be the dayâ¦You look for the good in everyone you meet and respect their journey.

All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on our thoughts and made up of our thoughts. If a man speak or act with an evil thought, suffering follows him as the wheel follows the hoof of the beast that draws the wagon.... If a man speak or act with a good thought, happiness follows him like a shadow that never leaves him.

The reason birds can fly and we can't is simply because they have perfect faith, for to have faith is to have wings.

God allows us to experience the low points of life in order to teach us lessons that we could learn in no other way.

I must be willing to give up what I am in order to become what I will be.

Death is no more than passing from one room into another. But there's a difference for me, you know. Because in that other room I shall be able to see.

The past is a place of reference, not a place of residence; the past is a place of learning, not a place of living.

I never want to change so much that people can't recognize me.

Accept yourself, love yourself, and keep moving forward. If you want to fly, you have to give up what weighs you down.

Life sucks, and then you die...

In the name of God, stop a moment, cease your work, look around you.

You'll never find a rainbow if you're looking down

Do not let the memories of your past limit the potential of your future. There are no limits to what you can achieve on your journey through life, except in your mind.

The higher we soar the smaller we appear to those who cannot fly.

Do not set aside your happiness. Do not wait to be happy in the future. The best time to be happy is always now.

Surround Yourself with People Who Believe in Your Dreams:
Surround yourself with people who believe in your dreams, encourage your ideas, support your ambitions, and bring out the best in you.

Sometimes you have to lose all you have to find out who you truly are.

Itâs your life; you donât need someoneâs permission to live the life you want. Be brave to live from your heart.

Not being heard is no reason for silence.

He that can have patience can have what he will.

You only need one man to love you. But him to love you free like a wildfire, crazy like the moon, always like tomorrow, sudden like an inhale and overcoming like the tides. Only one man and all of this.

Don't be afraid of enemies who attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you.

Everybody is special. Everybody. Everybody is a hero, a lover, a fool, a villain. Everybody. Everybody has their story to tell.

There is some kind of a sweet innocence in being human- in not having to be just happy or just sad- in the nature of being able to be both broken and whole, at the same time.

Be the reason someone smiles. Be the reason someone feels loved and believes in the goodness in people.

If you can keep your head when all about you 
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise
If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;
If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools
If you can make one heap of all your winnings 
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the will which says to them: 'Hold on!'
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
And - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!

Make improvements, not excuses. Seek respect, not attention.

Above all else, guard your heart for it affects everything else you do.

We travel, some of us forever, to seek other states, other lives, other souls.

Wanting to be someone else is a waste of who you are

The biggest adventure you can ever take is to live the life of your dreams.

Change the way you look at things and the things you look at change.

Treat everyone with politeness and kindness, not because they are nice, but because you are.

The only person who can pull me down is myself, and I'm not going to let myself pull me down anymore.

Keep Going
Your hardest times often lead to the greatest moments of your life. Keep going. Tough situations build strong people in the end.

Life is about accepting the challenges along the way, choosing to keep moving forward, and savoring the journey.

Death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside while still alive. Never surrender.

Learn to light a candle in the darkest moments of someoneâs life. Be the light that helps others see; it is what gives life its deepest significance.

Always find opportunities to make someone smile, and to offer random acts of kindness in everyday life.

Be brave to stand for what you believe in even if you stand alone.

I think that we are like stars. Something happens to burst us open; but when we burst open and think we are dying; weâre actually turning into a supernova. And then when we look at ourselves again, we see that weâre suddenly more beautiful than we ever were before!

Do not seek the because - in love there is no because, no reason, no explanation, no solutions.

Do not fear failure but rather fear not trying.

Pursue what catches your heart, not what catches your eyes.

The damage was permanent; there would always be scars. But even the angriest scars faded over time until it was difficult to see them written on the skin at all, and the only thing that remained was the memory of how painful it had been.

When the going gets tough, put one foot in front of the other and just keep going. Donât give up.

Time doesnât heal emotional pain, you need to learn how to let go.

Focus on your strengths, not your weaknesses.
Focus on your character, not your reputation.
Focus on your blessings, not your misfortunes.

You're beautiful, but you're empty...One couldn't die for you. Of course, an ordinary passerby would think my rose looked just like you. But my rose, all on her own, is more important than all of you together, since she's the one I've watered. Since she's the one I put under glass, since she's the one I sheltered behind the screen. Since she's the one for whom I killed the caterpillars (except the two or three butterflies). Since she's the one I listened to when she complained, or when she boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing at all. Since she's my rose.

No one really knows why they are alive until they know what they'd die for.

Swords can win territories but not hearts, forces can bend heads but not minds.

I live my life in widening circles that reach out across the world.

Every day, think as you wake up, today I am fortunate to be alive, I have a precious human life, I am not going to waste it. I am going to use all my energies to develop myself, to expand my heart out to others; to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings. I am going to have kind thoughts towards others, I am not going to get angry or think badly about others. I am going to benefit others as much as I can.

A Penny Saved is a Penny Earned

Excellence is never an accident. It is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, and intelligent execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives - choice, not chance, determines your destiny.

In the end you should always do the right thing even if it's hard.

Aim higher in case you fall short.

One Choice
One Choice, decided your friends.
One Choice, defines your beliefs.
One Choice, determines your loyalties - Forever.
ONCE CHOICE CAN TRANSFORM YOU

Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.

Dumbledore will only leave from Hogwarts when there are none loyal to him!

Make the most of yourself....for that is all there is of you.

We meet no ordinary people in our lives.

To shine your brightest light is to be who you truly are.

Believe you can and you're halfway there.

Be empty of worrying.
Think of who created thought!
Why do you stay in prison
When the door is so wide open?

Travel far enough, you meet yourself.

There is the great lesson of 'Beauty and the Beast,' that a thing must be loved before it is lovable.

It's okay,â he said. âWe're together.â He didn't say 
, or 
. After all they'd been through over the last year, he knew that the most important thing was that they were together. She loved him for saying that.

Around here, however, we don't look backwards for very long. We keep moving forward, opening up new doors and doing new things, because we're curious...and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.

Owning our story can be hard but not nearly as difficult as spending our lives running from it. Embracing our vulnerabilities is risky but not nearly as dangerous as giving up on love and belonging and joyâthe experiences that make us the most vulnerable. Only when we are brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light.

Be thankful for everything that happens in your life; itâs all an experience.

Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart.

I said to my soul, be still and wait without hope, for hope would be hope for the wrong thing; wait without love, for love would be love of the wrong thing; there is yet faith, but the faith and the love are all in the waiting. Wait without thought, for you are not ready for thought: So the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing.

There's so much to be grateful for, words are poor things.

If you believe very strongly in something, stand up and fight for it.

People have to forgive. We don't have to like them, we don't have to be friends with them, we don't have to send them hearts in text messages, but we have to forgive them, to overlook, to forget. Because if we don't we are tying rocks to our feet, too much for our wings to carry!

Do what you love, love what you do, and with all your heart give yourself to it.

Once you realize you deserve a bright future, letting go of your dark past is the best choice you will ever make.

People where you live," the little prince said, "grow five thousand roses in one garden... yet they don't find what they're looking for...
They don't find it," I answered.
And yet what they're looking for could be found in a single rose, or a little water..."
Of course," I answered.
And the little prince added, "But eyes are blind. You have to look with the heart.

If a man is called to be a street sweeper, he should sweep streets even as a Michaelangelo painted, or Beethoven composed music or Shakespeare wrote poetry. He should sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and earth will pause to say, 'Here lived a great street sweeper who did his job well.

There is nothing more rare, nor more beautiful, than a woman being unapologetically herself; comfortable in her perfect imperfection. To me, that is the true essence of beauty.

Believe in yourself. You are braver than you think, more talented than you know, and capable of more than you imagine.

Music melts all the separate parts of our bodies together.

Let the improvement of yourself keep you so busy that you have no time to criticize others.

A man with outward courage dares to die; a man with inner courage dares to live.

Every man is a damn fool for at least five minutes every day; wisdom consists in not exceeding the limit.

I'd rather learn from one bird how to sing 
than teach ten thousand stars how not to dance

There are two ways to reach me: by way of kisses or by way of the imagination. But there is a hierarchy: the kisses alone don't work.

Top 15 Things Money Canât Buy
Time. Happiness. Inner Peace. Integrity. Love. Character. Manners. Health. Respect. Morals. Trust. Patience. Class. Common sense. Dignity.

Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.

Stop comparing yourself to other people, just choose to be happy and live your own life.

Dream as if you will live forever; Live as if you will die today.

Listen with curiosity. Speak with honesty. Act with integrity. The greatest problem with communication is we donât listen to understand. We listen to reply. When we listen with curiosity, we donât listen with the intent to reply. We listen for whatâs behind the words.

I believe there is another world waiting for us. A better world. And I'll be waiting for you there.

Scar tissue is stronger than regular tissue. Realize the strength, move on.

Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around.

Always remember people who have helped you along the way, and donât forget to lift someone up.

Even if you cannot change all the people around you, you can change the people you choose to be around. Life is too short to waste your time on people who donât respect, appreciate, and value you. Spend your life with people who make you smile, laugh, and feel loved.

We either make ourselves miserable, or we make ourselves strong. The amount of work is the same.

Life has no remote....get up and change it yourself!

We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here.We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds, how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred?

You cannot control the behavior of others, but you can always choose how you respond to it.

My heart is warm with the friends I make,
And better friends I'll not be knowing,
Yet there isn't a train I wouldn't take,
No matter where it's going.

Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

The strongest people find the courage and caring to help others, even if they are going through their own storm.

Perfectionism is the enemy of happiness. Embrace being perfectly imperfect. Learn from your mistakes and forgive yourself, youâll be happier. We make mistakes because we are imperfect. Learn from your mistakes, forgive yourself, and keep moving forward.

To have what you have never had, you have to do what you have never done.

The best things in life make you sweaty.

When in a relationship, a real man doesn't make his woman jealous of others, he makes others jealous of his woman.

For like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach.

I like nonsense, it wakes up the brain cells. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living, It's a way of looking at life through the wrong end of a telescope. Which is what I do, And that enables you to laugh at life's realities.

Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender, be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly, and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love â for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you from misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labours and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world.

We are products of our past, but we don't have to be prisoners of it.

It is always the false that makes you suffer, the false desires and fears, the false values and ideas, the false relationships between people. Abandon the false and you are free of pain; truth makes happy, truth liberates.

Fiction is art and art is the triumph over chaosâ¦ to celebrate a world that lies spread out around us like a bewildering and stupendous dream.

What are you going to do with your life?" In one way or another it seemed that people had been asking her this forever; teachers, her parents, friends at three in the morning, but the question had never seemed this pressing and still she was no nearer an answer... "Live each day as if it's your last', that was the conventional advice, but really, who had the energy for that? What if it rained or you felt a bit glandy? It just wasn't practical. Better by far to be good and courageous and bold and to make difference. Not change the world exactly, but the bit around you. Cherish your friends, stay true to your principles, live passionately and fully and well. Experience new things. Love and be loved, if you ever get the chance.

I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings.

Happiness depends on your mindset and attitude.

But if I'm it, the last of my kind, the last page of human history, like hell I'm going to let the story end this way. I may be the last one, but I am the one still standing. I am the one turning to face the faceless hunter in the woods on an abandoned highway. I am the one not running but facing. Because if I am the last one, then I am humanity. And if this is humanity's last war, then I am the battlefield.

At the end of the day, let there be no excuses, no explanations, no regrets.

Those who look for the bad in people will surely find it.

Be Brave and Take Risks: You need to have faith in yourself. Be brave and take risks. You don't have to have it all figured out to move forward.

Real courage is when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.

Maturity is when you stop complaining and making excuses, and start making changes.

If you are lazy, and accept your lot, you may live in it. If you are willing to work, you can write your name anywhere you choose.

What would come, would come...and you would have to meet it, when it did.

What a large volume of adventures may be grasped within the span of his little life by him who interests his heart in everything.

Once we accept our limits, we go beyond them.

Do Not Lie to Yourself 
We have to be honest about what we want and take risks rather than lie to ourselves and make excuses to stay in our comfort zone.

There is a way to be good again...

Strong people have a strong sense of self-worth and self-awareness; they donât need the approval of others.

When you arise in the morning think of what a privilege it is to be alive, to think, to enjoy, to love ...

Stop giving other people the power to control your happiness, your mind, and your life. If you don't take control of yourself and your own life, someone else is bound to try.

The outer world is a reflection of the inner world. Other peopleâs perception of you is a reflection of them; your response to them is an awareness of you.

The biggest wall you have to climb is the one you build in your mind: Never let your mind talk you out of your dreams, trick you into giving up. Never let your mind become the greatest obstacle to success. To get your mind on the right track, the rest will follow.

Courage is feeling fear, not getting rid of fear, and taking action in the face of fear.

You are in charge of your own happiness; you don't need to wait for other people's permission to be happy.

If your feet are firmly planted on the ground you'll never be able to dance.

Just be yourself, there is no one better.

Be more concerned with your character than your reputation, because your character is what you really are, while your reputation is merely what others think you are.

Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.

I may not always be with you 
But when we're far apart
Remember you will be with me
Right inside my heart

We all make mistakes, have struggles, and even regret things in our past. But you are not your mistakes, you are not your struggles, and you are here NOW with the power to shape your day and your future.

I was suffering the easily foreseeable consequences. Addiction is the hallmark of every infatuation-based love story. It all begins when the object of your adoration bestows upon you a heady, hallucinogenic dose of something you never dared to admit you wanted-an emotional speedball, perhaps, of thunderous love and roiling excitement. Soon you start craving that intense attention, with a hungry obsession of any junkie. When the drug is witheld, you promptly turn sick, crazy, and depleted (not to mention resentful of the dealer who encouraged this addiction in the first place but now refuses to pony up the good stuff anymore-- despite the fact that you know he has it hidden somewhere, goddamn it, because he used to give it to you for free). Next stage finds you skinny and shaking in a corner, certain only that you would sell your soul or rob your neighbors just to have 'that thing' even one more time. Meanwhile, the object of your adoration has now become repulsed by you. He looks at you like you're someone he's never met before, much less someone he once loved with high passion. The irony is,you can hardly blame him. I mean, check yourself out. You're a pathetic mess,unrecognizable even to your own eyes. So that's it. You have now reached infatuation's final destination-- the complete and merciless devaluation of self." - pg 20-21

You've got this life and while you've got it, you'd better kiss like you only have one moment, try to hold someone's hand like you will never get another chance to, look into people's eyes like they're the last you'll ever see, watch someone sleeping like there's no time left, jump if you feel like jumping, run if you feel like running, play music in your head when there is none, and eat cake like it's the only one left in the world!

The greatest thing in the world is to know how to belong to oneself.

Be like the sun for grace and mercy. Be like the night to cover others' faults. Be like running water for generosity. Be like death for rage and anger. Be like the Earth for modesty. Appear as you are. Be as you appear.

I'd rather be a rising ape than a falling angel.

Any emotion, if it is sincere, is involuntary.

Those who bring sunshine to the lives of others cannot keep it from themselves.

Equality is not a concept. It's not something we should be striving for. It's a necessity. Equality is like gravity. We need it to stand on this earth as men and women, and the misogyny that is in every culture is not a true part of the human condition. It is life out of balance, and that imbalance is sucking something out of the soul of every man and woman who's confronted with it. We need equality. Kinda now.

Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself.

Responsibility to yourself means refusing to let others do your thinking, talking, and naming for you...it means that you do not treat your body as a commodity with which to purchase superficial intimacy or economic security; for our bodies to be treated as objects, our minds are in mortal danger. It means insisting that those to whom you give your friendship and love are able to respect your mind. It means being able to say, with Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre: "I have an inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all the extraneous delights should be withheld or offered only at a price I cannot afford to give.
Responsibility to yourself means that you don't fall for shallow and easy solutions--predigested books and ideas...marrying early as an escape from real decisions, getting pregnant as an evasion of already existing problems. It means that you refuse to sell your talents and aspirations short...and this, in turn, means resisting the forces in society which say that women should be nice, play safe, have low professional expectations, drown in love and forget about work, live through others, and stay in the places assigned to us. It means that we insist on a life of meaningful work, insist that work be as meaningful as love and friendship in our lives. It means, therefore, the courage to be "different"...The difference between a life lived actively, and a life of passive drifting and dispersal of energies, is an immense difference. Once we begin to feel committed to our lives, responsible to ourselves, we can never again be satisfied with the old, passive way.

Make a pact with yourself today to not be defined by your past. Sometimes the greatest thing to come out of all your hard work isn't what you get for it, but what you become for it. Shake things up today! Be You...Be Free...Share.

For myself I am an optimist - it does not seem to be much use to be anything else.

Resentment is like drinking poison and then hoping it will kill your enemies.

What you have to decide... is how you want your life to be. If your forever was ending tomorrow, would this be how you'd want to have spent it? Listen, the truth is, nothing is guaranteed. You know that more than anybody. So dont be afraid. Be alive.

Nothing can disturb your peace of mind unless you allow it to.

I will not try to convince you to love me, to respect me, to commit to me. I deserve better than that; I AM BETTER THAN THAT...Goodbye.

If you have a strong purpose in life, you don't have to be pushed. Your passion will drive you there.

Never stop dreaming, 
never stop believing, 
never give up, 
never stop trying, and 
never stop learning.

And out of that hopeless attempt has come nearly all that we call human historyâmoney, poverty, ambition, war, prostitution, classes, empires, slaveryâthe long terrible story of man trying to find something other than God which will make him happy.

It's never too late to change your life for the better. You don't have to take huge steps to change your life. Making even the smallest changes to your daily routine can make a big difference to your life.

Whenever something bad happens, keep calm, take a few deep breaths and shift the focus to something positive.

Patience Is Not the Ability to Wait: 
Patience is not the ability to wait. Patience is to be calm no matter what happens, constantly take action to turn it to positive growth opportunities, and have faith to believe that it will all work out in the end while you are waiting.

You Are the Master of Your Attitude
You cannot control what happens to you, but you can control the way you think about all the events. You always have a choice. You can choose to face them with a positive mental attitude.

I dreamed I spoke in another's language,
I dreamed I lived in another's skin,
I dreamed I was my own beloved,
I dreamed I was a tiger's kin.
I dreamed that Eden lived inside me,
And when I breathed a garden came,
I dreamed I knew all of Creation,
I dreamed I knew the Creator's name.
I dreamed--and this dream was the finest--
That all I dreamed was real and true,
And we would live in joy forever,
You in me, and me in you.

I learned this, at least, by my experiment; that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours..

After all," Anne had said to Marilla once, "I believe the nicest and sweetest days are not those on which anything very splendid or wonderful or exciting happens but just those that bring simple little pleasures, following one another softly, like pearls slipping off a string.

The great thing to remember is that though our feelings come and go God's love for us does not.

You must learn to let go. Release the stress. You were never in control anyway.

Man cannot discover new oceans unless he has the courage to lose sight of the shore.

When each day is the same as the next, itâs because people fail to recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises.

Getting something and having the wits to use it...those are two different things.

A mathematical formula for happiness:Reality divided by Expectations.There were two ways to be happy:improve your reality or lower your expectations.

I thank you God for this most amazing day, for the leaping greenly spirits of trees, and for the blue dream of sky and for everything which is natural, which is infinite, which is yes.

I'm not in search of sanctity, sacredness, purity; these things are found after this life, not in this life; but in this life I search to be completely human: to feel, to give, to take, to laugh, to get lost, to be found, to dance, to love and to lust, to be so human.

Never lose hope. Storms make people stronger and never last forever.

Oh the places you'll go! There is fun to be done! There are points to be scored. There are games to be won. And the magical things you can do with that ball will make you the winning-est winner of all.

If I am to be fallen into love, I will. And if as a result I will appear to be stupid, disillusioned, and of poor judgment, I will. And I would be damned if I cared what other people think. For I would rather be thought of as all of these things, than not love. If in loving, I become the naked woman on the horse, I will ride that horse with my head held high. This is my spirit. I am unbreakable.

There's more to life than dating the boy on the football team.

I never said it would be easy, I only said it would be worth it.

We come spinning out of nothingness, scattering stars like dust.

Kindness is not a business. True kindness expects nothing in return and should never act with conditions.

Don't ever take a fence down until you know why it was put up.

When you do the right thing, you get the feeling of peace and serenity associated with it. Do it again and again.

My father had taught me to be nice first, because you can always be mean later, but once you've been mean to someone, they won't believe the nice anymore. So be nice, be nice, until it's time to stop being nice, then destroy them.

Donât ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.

Never dull your shine for somebody else.

Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve.

Go into yourself. Find out the reason that commands you to write; see whether it has spread its roots into the very depths of your heart; confess to yourself whether you would have to die if you were forbidden to write. 
This most of all: ask yourself in the most silent hour of your night: must I write? Dig into yourself for a deep answer. And if this answer rings out in assent, if you meet this solemn question with a strong, simple âI must,â then build your life in accordance with this necessity; your whole life, even into its humblest and most indifferent hour, must become a sign and witness to this impulse. Then come close to Nature. Then, as if no one had ever tried before, try to say what you see and feel and love and lose...
...Describe your sorrows and desires, the thoughts that pass through your mind and your belief in some kind of beauty - describe all these with heartfelt, silent, humble sincerity and, when you express yourself, use the Things around you, the images from your dreams, and the objects that you remember. If your everyday life seems poor, donât blame it; blame yourself; admit to yourself that you are not enough of a poet to call forth its riches; because for the creator there is not poverty and no poor, indifferent place. And even if you found yourself in some prison, whose walls let in none of the worldâs sounds â wouldnât you still have your childhood, that jewel beyond all price, that treasure house of memories? Turn your attentions to it. Try to raise up the sunken feelings of this enormous past; your personality will grow stronger, your solitude will expand and become a place where you can live in the twilight, where the noise of other people passes by, far in the distance. - And if out of this turning-within, out of this immersion in your own world, poems come, then you will not think of asking anyone whether they are good or not. Nor will you try to interest magazines in these works: for you will see them as your dear natural possession, a piece of your life, a voice from it. A work of art is good if it has arisen out of necessity. That is the only way one can judge it.

Smile more. Smiling can make you and others happy.

Don't Just
Don't just learn, experience.
Don't just read, absorb.
Don't just change, transform.
Don't just relate, advocate.
Don't just promise, prove.
Don't just criticize, encourage.
Don't just think, ponder.
Don't just take, give.
Don't just see, feel.
Donât just dream, do. 
Don't just hear, listen.
Don't just talk, act.
Don't just tell, show.
Don't just exist, live.

Sometimes all a person wants is an empathetic ear; all he or she needs is to talk it out. Just offering a listening ear and an understanding heart for his or her suffering can be a big comfort.

You are unique. You have different talents and abilities. You donât have to always follow in the footsteps of others. And most important, you should always remind yourself that you don't have to do what everyone else is doing and have a responsibility to develop the talents you have been given.

Donât let others tell you what you canât do. Don't let the limitations of others limit your vision. If you can remove your self-doubt and believe in yourself, you can achieve what you never thought possible.

Without fear there cannot be courage.

Life is made of so many moments that mean nothing. Then one day, a single moment comes along to define every second that comes after. Such moments are tests of courage, of strength.

Since I was young, I have always known this: Life damages us, every one. We canât escape that damage. But now, I am also learning this: We can be mended. We mend each other

Don't think. Thinking is the enemy of creativity. It's self-conscious and anything self-conscious is lousy. You can't "try" to do things. You simply "must" do things.

Do not stop thinking of life as an adventure. You have no security unless you can live bravely, excitingly, imaginatively; unless you can choose a challenge instead of competence.

Weâre here, and then weâre gone, and itâs not about the time weâre here, but what we do with the time.

What's the world's greatest lie?... It's this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what's happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate.

If you do follow your bliss you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while, waiting for you, and the life that you ought to be living is the one you are living. Follow your bliss and don't be afraid, and doors will open where you didn't know they were going to be.

If you dare nothing, then when the day is over, nothing is all you will have gained.

We have to create culture, don't watch TV, don't read magazines, don't even listen to NPR. Create your own roadshow. The nexus of space and time where you are now is the most immediate sector of your universe, and if you're worrying about Michael Jackson or Bill Clinton or somebody else, then you are disempowered, you're giving it all away to icons, icons which are maintained by an electronic media so that you want to dress like X or have lips like Y. This is shit-brained, this kind of thinking. That is all cultural diversion, and what is real is you and your friends and your associations, your highs, your orgasms, your hopes, your plans, your fears. And we are told 'no', we're unimportant, we're peripheral. 'Get a degree, get a job, get a this, get a that.' And then you're a player, you don't want to even play in that game. You want to reclaim your mind and get it out of the hands of the cultural engineers who want to turn you into a half-baked moron consuming all this trash that's being manufactured out of the bones of a dying world.

With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,
it is still a beautiful world.
Be cheerful.
Strive to be happy.

Get Off The Scale!
You are beautiful. Your beauty, just like your capacity for life, happiness, and success, is immeasurable. Day after day, countless people across the globe get on a scale in search of validation of beauty and social acceptance.
Get off the scale! I have yet to see a scale that can tell you how enchanting your eyes are. I have yet to see a scale that can show you how wonderful your hair looks when the sun shines its glorious rays on it. I have yet to see a scale that can thank you for your compassion, sense of humor, and contagious smile. Get off the scale because I have yet to see one that can admire you for your perseverance when challenged in life.
Itâs true, the scale can only give you a numerical reflection of your relationship with gravity. Thatâs it. It cannot measure beauty, talent, purpose, life force, possibility, strength, or love. Donât give the scale more power than it has earned. Take note of the number, then get off the scale and live your life. You are beautiful!

The love that moves the sun and the other stars.

Bottom line is, even if you see 'em coming, you're not ready for the big moments. No one asks for their life to change, not really. But it does. So what are we, helpless? Puppets? No. The big moments are gonna come. You can't help that. It's what you do afterwards that counts. That's when you find out who you are.

Government exists to protect us from each other. Where government has gone beyond its limits is in deciding to protect us from ourselves.

The universe is big, its vast and complicated, and ridiculous. And sometimes, very rarely, impossible things just happen and we call them miracles. And that's the theory. Nine hundred years, never seen one yet, but this would do me.

Do all the good you can. By all the means you can. In all the ways you can. In all the places you can. At all the times you can. To all the people you can. As long as ever you can.

If you hang out with chickens, you're going to cluck and if you hang out with eagles, you're going to fly.

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

ÙØ§ ØªØ¨Ø­Ø« Ø¹ÙÙ ÙØ¨Ø­Ø« Ø¹ÙÙ

Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius â and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction.

Do not let arrogance go to your head and despair to your heart; do not let compliments go to your head and criticisms to your heart; do not let success go to your head and failure to your heart.

A dream is a wish your heart makes, when you're fast asleep.

Fake it 'till you make it.

The power of finding beauty in the humblest things makes home happy and life lovely.

Being grateful does not mean that everything is necessarily good. It just means that you can accept it as a gift.

Everyone you meet is a part of your journey, but not all of them are meant to stay in your life. Some people are just passing through to bring you gifts; either they're blessings or lessons.

A smile puts you on the right track. A smile makes the world a beautiful place. When you lose your smile, you lose your way in the chaos of life.

Great leaders create more leaders, not followers.

Always have a willing hand to help someone, you might be the only one that does.

Those who do not weep, do not see.

It is by no means an irrational fancy that, in a future existence, we shall look upon what we think our present existence, as a dream.

Life was meant to be lived, and curiosity must be kept alive. One must never, for whatever reason, turn his back on life.

No matter who you are, no matter what you did, no matter where you've come from, you can always change, become a better version of yourself.

People don't realize how a man's whole life can be changed by one book.

Let us rise up and be thankful, for if we didn't learn a lot at least we learned a little, and if we didn't learn a little, at least we didn't get sick, and if we got sick, at least we didn't die; so, let us all be thankful.

Whatever comes," she said, "cannot alter one thing. If I am a princess in rags and tatters, I can be a princess inside. It would be easy to be a princess if I were dressed in cloth of gold, but it is a great deal more of a triumph to be one all the time when no one knows it.

Renew, release, let go. Yesterdayâs gone. Thereâs nothing you can do to bring it back. You canât âshouldâveâ done something. You can only DO something. Renew yourself. Release that attachment. Today is a new day!

I know that pain is the most important thing in the universes. Greater than survival, greater than love, greater even than the beauty it brings about. For without pain, there can be no pleasure. Without sadness, there can be no happiness. Without misery there can be no beauty. And without these, life is endless, hopeless, doomed and damned. 
Adult. You have become adult.

No! Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try.

But life is a battle: may we all be enabled to fight it well!

If you're horrible to me, I'm going to write a song about it, and you won't like it. That's how I operate.

How would your life be different ifâ¦You walked away from gossip and verbal defamation? Let today be the dayâ¦You speak only the good you know of other people and encourage others to do the same.

The best discoveries always happened to the people who weren't looking for them.

Don't think about making life better for other people who don't even deserve you, rather, focus on making your life the best, for yourself and those who love you.

To call woman the weaker sex is a libel; it is man's injustice to woman. If by strength is meant brute strength, then, indeed, is woman less brute than man. If by strength is meant moral power, then woman is immeasurably man's superior. Has she not greater intuition, is she not more self-sacrificing, has she not greater powers of endurance, has she not greater courage? Without her, man could not be. If nonviolence is the law of our being, the future is with woman. Who can make a more effective appeal to the heart than woman?"

You buy furniture. You tell yourself, this is the last sofa I will ever need in my life. Buy the sofa, then for a couple years you're satisfied that no matter what goes wrong, at least you've got your sofa issue handled. Then the right set of dishes. Then the perfect bed. The drapes. The rug. Then you're trapped in your lovely nest, and the things you used to own, now they own you.

Behind every trial and sorrow that He makes us shoulder, God has a reason.

Of all creatures that breathe and move upon the earth, nothing is bred that is weaker than man.

All The Woulda-Coulda-Shouldas
Layin' In The Sun,
Talkin' 'Bout The Things
They Woulda-Coulda-Shoulda Done...
But All Those Woulda-Coulda-Shouldas
All Ran Away And Hid
From One Little Did.

What's done is done. What's gone is gone. One of life's lessons is always moving on. Itâs okay to look back to see how far youâve come but keep moving forward.

It's the children the world almost breaks who grow up to save it.

Live the Life of Your Dreams
When you start living the life of your dreams, there will always be obstacles, doubters, mistakes and setbacks along the way. But with hard work, perseverance and self-belief there is no limit to what you can achieve.

I heard a definition once: Happiness is health and a short memory! I wish I'd invented it, because it is very true.

Each day brings new opportunities, allowing you to constantly live with loveâbe there for othersâbring a little light into someone's day. Be grateful and live each day to the fullest.

You cannot change anyone, but you can be the reason someone changes.

Guard well your thoughts when alone and your words when accompanied.

If you donât give up on something you truly believe in, you will find a way.

Be the positive impact on the lives of others.

Amateurs sit and wait for inspiration, the rest of us just get up and go to work.

A goal without a plan is just a wish.

But remember, boy, that a kind act can sometimes be as powerful as a sword.

If a problem is fixable, if a situation is such that you can do something about it, then there is no need to worry. If it's not fixable, then there is no help in worrying. There is no benefit in worrying whatsoever.

Life before Death.
Strength before Weakness.
Journey before Destination.

The rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened.

Be melting snow.
Wash yourself of yourself.

I'm unpredictable, I never know where I'm going until I get there, I'm so random, I'm always growing, learning, changing, I'm never the same person twice. But one thing you can be sure of about me; is I will always do exactly what I want to do.

Remember that everyone you meet is afraid of something, loves something and has lost something.

Shallow men believe in luck or in circumstance. Strong men believe in cause and effect.

You are, after all, what you think. Your emotions are the slaves to your thoughts, and you are the slave to your emotions.

The easiest thing to be in the world is you. The most difficult thing to be is what other people want you to be. Don't let them put you in that position.

However mean your life is, meet it and live it; do not shun it and call it hard names. It is not so bad as you are. It looks poorest when you are richest. The fault-finder will find faults even in paradise. Love your life, poor as it is. You may perhaps have some pleasant, thrilling, glorious hours, even in a poorhouse. 
. I do not see but a quiet mind may live as contentedly there, and have as cheering thoughts, as in a palace.

Certain thoughts are prayers. There are moments when, whatever be the attitude of the body, the soul is on its knees.

If you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely.

Nothing is permanent in this wicked world, not even our troubles.

Our life is what our thoughts make it.

It was always the becoming he dreamed of, never the being.

Forget yesterday - it has already forgotten you. Don't sweat tomorrow - you haven't even met. Instead, open your eyes and your heart to a truly precious gift - today.

The person in life that you will always be with the most, is yourself. Because even when you are with others, you are still with yourself, too! When you wake up in the morning, you are with yourself, laying in bed at night you are with yourself, walking down the street in the sunlight you are with yourself.What kind of person do you want to walk down the street with? What kind of person do you want to wake up in the morning with? What kind of person do you want to see at the end of the day before you fall asleep? Because that person is yourself, and it's your responsibility to be that person you want to be with. I know I want to spend my life with a person who knows how to let things go, who's not full of hate, who's able to smile and be carefree. So that's who I have to be.

No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.

To love means loving the unlovable. To forgive means pardoning the unpardonable. Faith means believing the unbelievable. Hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless.

I've come to believe that each of us has a personal calling that's as unique as a fingerprint - and that the best way to succeed is to discover what you love and then find a way to offer it to others in the form of service, working hard, and also allowing the energy of the universe to lead you. 

I think that the best thing we can do for our children is to allow them to do things for themselves, allow them to be strong, allow them to experience life on their own terms, allow them to take the subway... let them be better people, let them believe more in themselves.

If you dont have any shadows you're not in the light

How far that little candle throws his beams! So shines a good deed in a weary world.

Seindah apa pun huruf terukir, dapatkah ia bermakna apabila tak ada jeda? Dapatkan ia dimengerti jika tak ada spasi? Bukankah kita baru bisa bergerak jika ada jarak? Dan saling menyayang bila ada ruang?

Remember, if you ever need a helping hand, it's at the end of your arm, as you get older, remember you have another hand: The first is to help yourself, the second is to help others.

Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference.

Dreams don't work unless you take action. The surest way to make your dreams come true is to live them.

In the long run, the sharpest weapon of all is a kind and gentle spirit.

I have a dream that one day little black boys and girls will be holding hands with little white boys and girls.

We must live together as brothers or perish together as fools.

Every blessing ignored becomes a curse.

I sustain myself with the love of family.

People say that eyes are windows to the soul.

Only those who attempt the absurd can achieve the impossible.

Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.

So many things are possible as long as you don't know they are impossible.

A hero is no braver than an ordinary man, but he is brave five minutes longer.

Start a huge, foolish project, like Noahâ¦it makes absolutely no difference what people think of you.

I do not care so much what I am to others as I care what I am to myself.

All I can be is me- whoever that is. 

Being brave is when you have to do something because you know it is right, but at the same time, you are afraid to do it, because it might hurt or whatever. But you do it anyway.

In the end, you have to choose whether or not to trust someone.

But still, I find the need to remind myself of the temporariness of a day, to reassure myself that I got through yesterday, I'll get through today.

No life is a waste," the Blue Man said. "The only time we waste is the time we spend thinking we're alone.

I'll think of it tomorrow, at Tara. I can stand it then. Tomorrow, I'll think of some way to get him back. After all, tomorrow is another day.

My task, which I am trying to achieve is, by the power of the written word, to make you hear, to make you feel--it is, before all, to make you see.

Write it. Shoot it. Publish it. Crochet it, sautÃ© it, whatever. MAKE.

You save yourself or you remain unsaved.

The surest way to make your dreams come true is to live them.

Life doesnât get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient.

Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any one thing.

For beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror
which we are barely able to endure, and it amazes us so,
because it serenely disdains to destroy us.
Every angel is terrible.

You are not the victim of the world, but rather the master of your own destiny. It is your choices and decisions that determine your destiny.

A smart person knows how to talk. A wise person knows when to be silent.

Turn your obstacles into opportunities and your problems into possibilities.

Learning to distance yourself from all the negativity is one of the greatest lessons to achieve inner peace.

In friendship...we think we have chosen our peers. In reality a few years' difference in the dates of our births, a few more miles between certain houses, the choice of one university instead of another...the accident of a topic being raised or not raised at a first meeting--any of these chances might have kept us apart. But, for a Christian, there are, strictly speaking no chances. A secret master of ceremonies has been at work. Christ, who said to the disciples, "Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you," can truly say to every group of Christian friends, "Ye have not chosen one another but I have chosen you for one another." The friendship is not a reward for our discriminating and good taste in finding one another out. It is the instrument by which God reveals to each of us the beauties of others.

I have come home at last! This is my real country! I belong here. This is the land I have been looking for all my life, though I never knew it till now...Come further up, come further in!

You must take life the way it comes at you and make the best of it.

Life is funny. Things change, people change, but you will always be you, so stay true to yourself and never sacrifice who you are for anyone.

The dog is a gentleman; I hope to go to his heaven not man's.

Only he who attempts the absurd is capable of achieving the impossible.

I trust that everything happens for a reason, even if we are not wise enough to see it.

Fear doesn't shut you down; it wakes you up. I've seen it. It's fascinating." He releases me but doesn't pull away, his hand grazing my jaw, my neck. "Sometimes I just...want to see it again. Want to see you awake.

Not knowing you can't do something, is sometimes all it takes to do it.

The universe is made of stories, not of atoms.

Everything's a risk. Not doing anything is a risk. It's up to you.

Music is the literature of the heart; it commences where speech ends.

Dripping water hollows out stone, not through force but through persistence.

There's nothing wrong with you. There's a lot wrong with the world you live in. And definitely get out of high school and make everyone sorry.

Live today. Not yesterday. Not tomorrow. Just today. Inhabit your moments. Donât rent them out to tomorrow. Do you know what youâre doing when you spend a moment wondering how things are going to turn out with Perry?
Youâre cheating yourself out of today. Today is calling to you, trying to get your attention, but youâre stuck on tomorrow, and today trickles away like water down a drain. You wake up the next morning and that today you wasted is gone forever. Itâs now yesterday. Some of those moments may have had wonderful things in store for you , but now youâll never know.

Life is a process of becoming, a combination of states we have to go through. Where people fail is that they wish to elect a state and remain in it. This is a kind of death.

you
not wanting me

the beginning of me
wanting myself
thank you

Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

Anger is like flowing water; there's nothing wrong with it as long as you let it flow. Hate is like stagnant water; anger that you denied yourself the freedom to feel, the freedom to flow; water that you gathered in one place and left to forget. Stagnant water becomes dirty, stinky, disease-ridden, poisonous, deadly; that is your hate. On flowing water travels little paper boats; paper boats of forgiveness. Allow yourself to feel anger, allow your waters to flow, along with all the paper boats of forgiveness. Be human.

Without leaps of imagination or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all is a form of planning.

The truth is that the world is full of dragons, and none of us are as powerful or cool as weâd like to be. And that sucks. But when youâre confronted with that fact, you can either crawl into a hole and quit, or you can get out there, take off your shoes, and Bilbo it up.

When you see a good person, think of becoming like her/him. When you see someone not so good, reflect on your own weak points.

I want to live my life in such a way that when I get out of bed in the morning, the devil says, "aw shit, he's up!

Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet he is lord of all the animals. He sets them to work, he gives back to them the bare minimum that will prevent them from starving, and the rest he keeps for himself.

Life moves on, whether we act as cowards or heroes. Life has no other discipline to impose, if we would but realize it, than to accept life unquestioningly. Everything we shut our eyes to, everything we run away from, everything we deny, denigrate or despise, serves to defeat us in the end. What seems nasty, painful, evil, can become a source of beauty, joy, and strength, if faced with an open mind. Every moment is a golden one for him who has the vision to recognize it as such

It's worth making time to find the things that really stir your soul. Thatâs what makes you really feel alive. You have to say ânoâ to other things youâre used to, and do it with all your heart.

It takes sunshine and rain to make a rainbow. There would be no rainbows without sunshine and rain.

Discipline Your Mind to Think Positively: Discipline your mind to see the good in every situation and look on the best side of every event.

Focus on your goals, not your fear. 
Focus like a laser beam on your goals.

When one has a grateful heart, life is so beautiful.

I am a happy camper so I guess Iâm doing something right. Happiness is like a butterfly; the more you chase it, the more it will elude you, but if you turn your attention to other things, it will come and sit softly on your shoulder.

Oh, what a tangled web we weave...when first we practice to deceive.

As my sufferings mounted I soon realized that there were two ways in which I could respond to my situation -- either to react with bitterness or seek to transform the suffering into a creative force. I decided to follow the latter course.

Though the road's been rocky it sure feels good to me.

I read somewhere... how important it is in life not necessarily to be strong, but to feel strong... to measure yourself at least once.

Believe nothing, no matter where you read it, or who said it, no matter if I have said it, unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense.

You're never given a dream without also being given the power to make it true.

Bitch (noun): A woman who won't bang her head against the wall obsessing over someone else's opinion - be it a man or anyone else in her life. She understands that if someone does not approve of her, it's just one person's opinion; therefore, it's of no real importance. She doesn't try to live up to anyone else's standards - only her own. Because of this, she relates to a man very differently.

You may choose to look the other way but you can never say again that you did not know.

You're alive, Bod. That means you have infinite potential. You can do anything, make anything, dream anything. If you can change the world, the world will change. Potential. Once you're dead, it's gone. Over. You've made what you've made, dreamed your dream, written your name. You may be buried here, you may even walk. But that potential is finished.

This life is yours. Take the power to choose what you want to do and do it well. Take the power to love what you want in life and love it honestly. Take the power to walk in the forest and be a part of nature. Take the power to control your own life. No one else can do it for you. Take the power to make your life happy.

A Woman in harmony with her spirit

She goes where she will without pretense and arrives at her destination

He is free to evade reality, he is free to unfocus his mind and stumble blindly down any road he pleases, but not free to avoid the abyss he refuses to see.

That which God said to the rose, and caused it to laugh in full-blown beauty, He said to my heart, and made it a hundred times more beautiful.

Amor Fati â âLove Your Fateâ, which is in fact your life.

Count your blessings, not your problems. Count your own blessings, not someone else's. Remember that jealousy is when you count someone else's blessings instead of your own.

Do not worry about your difficulties in Mathematics. I can assure you mine are still greater.

The stupid neither forgive nor forget; the naive forgive and forget; the wise forgive but do not forget.

Dare to love yourself
as if you were a rainbow
with gold at both ends.

We've all started to put down the virtues of the other factions in the process of bolstering our own. I don't want to do that. I want to be brave, and selfless, and smart, and kind, and honest." He clears his throat. "I continually struggle with kindness.

Most of us must learn to love people and use things rather than loving things and using people.

Never let hard lessons harden your heart; the hard lessons of life are meant to make you better, not bitter.

Integrity is doing the right thing when nobody's watching, and doing as you say you would do.

Failure is a bend in the road, not the end of the road. Learn from failure and keep moving forward.

You donât have to like someone, but you have to treat them as you wish to be treated.

Until you step into the unknown, you donât know what youâre made of.

Donât wait for things to happen. Make them happen.

Good things happen in your life when you surround yourself with positive people.

It takes guts and humility to admit mistakes. Admitting we're wrong is courage, not weakness.

If you don't know who you truly are, you'll never know what you really want.

We are like sculptors, constantly carving out of others the image we long for, need, love or desire, often against reality, against their benefit, and always, in the end, a disappointment, because it does not fit them.

I'm not saying I'm gonna change the world, but I guarantee that I will spark the brain that will change the world.

To the world you may be one person but to one person you may be the world.

There are two kinds of teachers: the kind that fill you with so much quail shot that you can't move, and the kind that just gives you a little prod behind and you jump to the skies.

When I was growing up I always wanted to be someone. Now I realize I should have been more specific.

How would your life be different ifâ¦You stopped allowing other people to dilute or poison your day with their words or opinions? Let today be the dayâ¦You stand strong in the truth of your beauty and journey through your day without attachment to the validation of others

People say that what weâre all seeking is a meaning for life. I donât think thatâs what weâre really seeking. I think that what weâre seeking is an experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonances with our own innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive.

Get up, stand up, Stand up for your rights. Get up, stand up, Don't give up the fight.

Iâm boredâ is a useless thing to say. I mean, you live in a great, big, vast world that youâve seen none percent of. Even the inside of your own mind is endless; it goes on forever, inwardly, do you understand? The fact that youâre alive is amazing, so you donât get to say âIâm bored.

Youâre not obligated to win. Youâre obligated to keep trying. To the best you can do everyday.

I just hope I remember to tell my kids that they are as happy as I look in my old photographs. And I hope that they believe me.

You must find the place inside yourself where nothing is impossible.

Don't confuse poor decision-making with destiny. Own your mistakes. Itâs ok; we all make them. Learn from them so they can empower you!

Surround yourself only with people who are going to take you higher.

Adapt what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is specifically your own.

No, this is not the beginning of a new chapter in my life; this is the beginning of a new book! That first book is already closed, ended, and tossed into the seas; this new book is newly opened, has just begun! Look, it is the first page! And it is a beautiful one!

Remember tonight... for it is the beginning of always

The fishermen know that the sea is dangerous and the storm terrible, but they have never found these dangers sufficient reason for remaining ashore.

Heaven can be found in the most unlikely corners.

Real magic can never be made by offering someone else's liver. You must tear out your own, and not expect to get it back.

Darling, when things go wrong in life, you lift your chin, put on a ravishing smile, mix yourself a little cocktail...

See, as much as you want to hold on to the bitter sore memory that someone has left this world, you are still in it

Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.

The Reality of The Other Person Lies Not In What He Reveals To You, But What He Cannot Reveal To You.
Therefore, If You Would Understand Him, Listen Not To What He Says, But Rather To What He Does Not Say.

It doesnât matter how many times you get knocked down. All that matters is you get up one more time than you were knocked down.

Don't wait for the right moment to start, start and make each moment right.

Good people see the good and bring out the best in other people.

What you stay focused on will grow.

Gratitude builds a bridge to abundance.

Do not let the roles you play in life make you forget who you are.

It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.

Art is the proper task of life. 

Weekends don't count unless you spend them doing something completely pointless.

The place to improve the world is first in one's own heart and head and hands, and then work outward from there.

If you start by promising what you don't even have yet, you'll lose your desire to work towards getting it.

The tears of the world are a constant quantity. For each one who begins to weep somewhere else another stops. The same is true of the laugh.

It does not matter how long you are spending on the earth, how much money you have gathered or how much attention you have received. It is the amount of positive vibration you have radiated in life that matters,

When you hold a grudge, you want someone elseâs sorrow to reflect your level of hurt but the two rarely meet.

To be rejected by someone doesn't mean you should also reject yourself or that you should think of yourself as a lesser person. It doesn't mean that nobody will ever love you anymore. Remember that only ONE person has rejected you at the moment, and it only hurt so much because to you, that person's opinion symbolized the opinion of the whole world, of God.

The most important decision you make is to be in a good mood.

The only position that leaves me with no cognitive dissonance is atheism. It is not a creed. Death is certain, replacing both the siren-song of Paradise and the dread of Hell. Life on this earth, with all its mystery and beauty and pain, is then to be lived far more intensely: we stumble and get up, we are sad, confident, insecure, feel loneliness and joy and love. There is nothing more; but I want nothing more.

My happiness is not the means to any end. It is the end. It is its own goal. It is its own purpose.

Start by doing what is necessary, then what is possible, and suddenly you are doing the impossible.

the time is always right to do the right thing

When you look for a man- what you want to look for is a man with the heart of a poor boy and the mind of a conqueror.

Bermimpilah, karena Tuhan akan memeluk mimpi-mimpi itu.

There are times when solitude is better than society, and silence is wiser than speech. We should be better Christians if we were more alone, waiting upon God, and gathering through meditation on His Word spiritual strength for labour in his service. We ought to muse upon the things of God, because we thus get the real nutriment out of them. . . . Why is it that some Christians, although they hear many sermons, make but slow advances in the divine life? Because they neglect their closets, and do not thoughtfully meditate on God's Word. They love the wheat, but they do not grind it; they would have the corn, but they will not go forth into the fields to gather it; the fruit hangs upon the tree, but they will not pluck it; the water flows at their feet, but they will not stoop to drink it. From such folly deliver us, O Lord. . . .

Let me never fall into the vulgar mistake of dreaming that I am persecuted whenever I am contradicted.

One of the most spiritual things you can do is embrace your humanity. Connect with those around you today. Say, "I love you", "I'm sorry", "I appreciate you", "I'm proud of you"...whatever you're feeling. Send random texts, write a cute note, embrace your truth and share it...cause a smile today for someone else...and give plenty of hugs.

Think, Believe, Dream, and Dare.

I've been lucky. Opportunities don't often come along. So, when they do, you have to grab them.

I postpone death by living, by suffering, by error, by risking, by giving, by losing.

It [feminism] is mixed up with a muddled idea that women are free when they serve their employers but slaves when they help their husbands.

Some things cannot be taught; they must be experienced. You never learn the most valuable lessons in life until you go through your own journey.

It is difficult to live in and enjoy the moment when you are thinking about the past or worrying about the future. You cannot change your past, but you can ruin the present by worrying about your future. Learn from the past, plan for the future. The more you live in and enjoy the present moment, the happier you will be.

When things do not go your way, remember that every challenge â every adversity â contains within it the seeds of opportunity and growth.

Itâs important that what thoughts you are feeding into your mind because your thoughts create your belief and experiences. You have positive thoughts and you have negative ones too. Nurture your mind with positive thoughts: kindness, empathy, compassion, peace, love, joy, humility, generosity, etc. The more you feed your mind with positive thoughts, the more you can attract great things into your life.

Challenge and adversity are meant to help you know who you are. Storms hit your weakness, but unlock your true strength.

Nothing makes a person happier than having a happy heart.

We all need to be mocked from time to time, lest we take ourselves too seriously.

Things do not change; we change.

We are the music-makers,
And we are the dreamers of dreams,
Wandering by lone sea-breakers,
And sitting by desolate streams.
World-losers and world-forsakers,
Upon whom the pale moon gleams;
Yet we are the movers and shakers,
Of the world forever, it seems.

So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservatism, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more dangerous to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a manâs living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun.

I do not believe in taking the right decision, I take a decision and make it right.

If we ever forget that we're one nation under God, then we will be one nation gone under.

We are saved by faith alone, but the faith that saves is never alone.

Keep your eyes on the stars, and your feet on the ground.

Friendship with oneself is all important, because without it one cannot be friends with anyone else in the world.

Growing up means learning what life is. When you're little, you have a set of ideals, standards, criteria, plans, outlooks, and you think that you have to sit around and wait for them to happen to you and then life will work. But life isn't like that, for anybody; you can't fall in love with a standard, you have to fall in love with a person. You can't live in a criteria, you have to live your life. You can't wait for your plans to materialize, because they may never materialize the way you think they will. You can't wait to watch your ideals and standards walk up to you, because you can't know what's yours until you have it. I always say, always take the first chance in case you never get a second one, but growing up takes that even one step further, growing up means that you have to hold on to what you have, when you have it, because what you have- that's yours- and all the ideals and criteria you have set in your head, those aren't yours, because those haven't happened to you.

Down on the lake rosy reflections of celestial vapor appeared, and I said, "God, I love you" and looked to the sky and really meant it. "I have fallen in love with you, God. Take care of us all, one way or the other." To the children and the innocent it's all the same.

The duty of youth is to challenge corruption.

A creative life cannot be sustained by approval any more than it can be destroyed by criticism.

The place where you made your stand never mattered. Only that you were there...and still on your feet.

You become what you think about all day long.

So early in my life, I had learned that if you want something, you had better make some noise.

Envy is ignorance, 
Imitation is Suicide.

I offer you peace. I offer you love. I offer you friendship. I see your beauty. I hear your need. I feel your feelings.

I disregard the proportions, the measures, the tempo of the ordinary world. I refuse to live in the ordinary world as ordinary women. To enter ordinary relationships. I want ecstasy. I am a neurotic â in the sense that I live in my world. I will not adjust myself to the world. I am adjusted to myself.

Maktub" (It is written.)

Do you really want to be happy? You can begin by being appreciative of who you are and what you've got.

If you want to write a fantasy story with Norse gods, sentient robots, and telepathic dinosaurs, you can do just that. Want to throw in a vampire and a lesbian unicorn while you're at it? Go ahead. Nothing's off limits. But the endless possibility of the genre is a trap. It's easy to get distracted by the glittering props available to you and forget what you're supposed to be doing: telling a good story. Don't get me wrong, magic is cool. But a nervous mother singing to her child at night while something moves quietly through the dark outside her house? That's a story. Handled properly, it's more dramatic than any apocalypse or goblin army could ever be.

All great achievements require time.

The beautiful journey of today can only begin when we learn to let go of yesterday.

Sit in a room and read--and read and read. And read the right books by the right people. Your mind is brought onto that level, and you have a nice, mild, slow-burning rapture all the time.

Enjoy every step you take. If you're curious, there is always something new to be discovered in the backdrop of your daily life.

Stop doing what is easy. Start doing what is right.

Changing your outside world cannot make you happy if you are an unhappy person. The real personal change can only happen from the inside out. If you firstly create the change within yourself, you can turn your life around.

Successful people have no fear of failure. But unsuccessful people do. Successful people have the resilience to face up to failureâlearn the lessons and adapt from it.

It doesn't matter how many people you meet in your life; you just need the real ones who accept you for who you are and help you become who you should be.

Well done is better than well said.

Even if things don't unfold the way you expected, don't be disheartened or give up. One who continues to advance will win in the end.

Let today be the day you stop being haunted by the ghost of yesterday. Holding a grudge & harboring anger/resentment is poison to the soul. Get even with people...but not those who have hurt us, forget them, instead get even with those who have helped us.

Although I'm only fourteen, I know quite well what I want, I know who is right and who is wrong. I have my opinions, my own ideas and principles, and although it may sound pretty mad from an adolescent, I feel more of a person than a child, I feel quite indepedent of anyone.

Walk with the dreamers, the believers, the courageous, the cheerful, the planners, the doers, the successful people with their heads in the clouds and their feet on the ground. Let their spirit ignite a fire within you to leave this world better than when you found it...

Anything thatâs human is mentionable, and anything that is mentionable can be more manageable. When we can talk about our feelings, they become less overwhelming, less upsetting, and less scary. The people we trust with that important talk can help us know that we are not alone.

Instead of cursing the darkness, light a candle.

Ruin is a gift. Ruin is the road to transformation.

I've had a lot of worries in my life, most of which never happened.

It was like the beginning of life and laughter. It was the real meaning of the sun

I have learned that you can go anywhere you want to go and do anything you want to do and buy all the things that you want to buy and meet all the people that you want to meet and learn all the things that you desire to learn and if you do all these things but are not madly in love: you have still not begun to live.

To each there comes in their lifetime a special moment when they are figuratively tapped on the shoulder and offered the chance to do a very special thing, unique to them and fitted to their talents. What a tragedy if that moment finds them unprepared or unqualified for that which could have been their finest hour.

All I ask is one thing, and Iâm asking this particularly of young people: please donât be cynical. I hate cynicism, for the record, itâs my least favorite quality and it doesnât lead anywhere. Nobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get. But if you work really hard and youâre kind, amazing things will happen.

If my mind can conceive it, and my heart can believe it - then I can achieve it.

I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him but what he thinks of himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime.

For everything in this journey of life we are on, there is a right wing and a left wing: for the wing of love there is anger; for the wing of destiny there is fear; for the wing of pain there is healing; for the wing of hurt there is forgiveness; for the wing of pride there is humility; for the wing of giving there is taking; for the wing of tears there is joy; for the wing of rejection there is acceptance; for the wing of judgment there is grace; for the wing of honor there is shame; for the wing of letting go there is the wing of keeping. We can only fly with two wings and two wings can only stay in the air if there is a balance. Two beautiful wings is perfection. There is a generation of people who idealize perfection as the existence of only one of these wings every time. But I see that a bird with one wing is imperfect. An angel with one wing is imperfect. A butterfly with one wing is dead. So this generation of people strive to always cut off the other wing in the hopes of embodying their ideal of perfection, and in doing so, have created a crippled race.

The minute I stopped trying to find the right girl, and started trying to become the right guy...the girl came.

It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit.

Know thyself.

The less you associate with some people, the more your life will improve.
Any time you tolerate mediocrity in others, it increases your mediocrity. An
important attribute in successful people is their impatience with negative
thinking and negative acting people. As you grow, your associates will
change. Some of your friends will not want you to go on. They will want you
to stay where they are. Friends that don't help you climb will want you to
crawl. Your friends will stretch your vision or choke your dream. Those that
don't increase you will eventually decrease you.
Consider this:
Never receive counsel from unproductive people. Never discuss your problems
with someone incapable of contributing to the solution, because those who
never succeed themselves are always first to tell you how. Not everyone has
a right to speak into your life. You are certain to get the worst of the
bargain when you exchange ideas with the wrong person. Don't follow anyone
who's not going anywhere.
With some people you spend an evening: with others you invest it. Be careful
where you stop to inquire for directions along the road of life. Wise is the
person who fortifies his life with the right friendships. If you run with
wolves, you will learn how to howl. But, if you associate with eagles, you
will learn how to soar to great heights.
"A mirror reflects a man's face, but what he is really like is shown by the
kind of friends he chooses."
The simple but true fact of life is that you become like those with whom you
closely associate - for the good and the bad.
Note: Be not mistaken. This is applicable to family as well as friends.
Yes...do love, appreciate and be thankful for your family, for they will
always be your family no matter what. Just know that they are human first
and though they are family to you, they may be a friend to someone else and
will fit somewhere in the criteria above.
"In Prosperity Our Friends Know Us. In Adversity We Know Our friends."
"Never make someone a priority when you are only an option for them."
"If you are going to achieve excellence in big things,you develop the habit in little matters.
Excellence is not an exception, it is a prevailing attitude.."..

You come of the Lord Adam and the Lady Eve," said Aslan. "And that is both honour enough to erect the head of the poorest beggar, and shame enough to bow the shoulders of the greatest emperor on earth. Be content.

You get in life what you have the courage to ask for.

I hate to say it, but shit really does happen. You just have to get over it. Beat the hell out of it by doing things that make you happy.

The greatest ideas are the simplest.

You learn something valuable from all of the significant events and people, but you never touch your true potential until you challenge yourself to go beyond imposed limitations.

7 Effective Ways to Make Others Feel Important 
1. Use their name.
2. Express sincere gratitude.
3. Do more listening than talking.
4. Talk more about them than about you.
5. Be authentically interested.
6. Be sincere in your praise.
7. Show you care.

Beliefs are choices. First you choose your beliefs. Then your beliefs affect your choices.

Everyone enjoys being acknowledged and appreciated. Sometimes even the simplest act of gratitude can change someone's entire day. Take the time to recognize and value the people around you and appreciate those who make a difference in your lives.

Life is short. Focus on what really matters most. You have to change your priorities over time.

Always believe in yourself and always stretch yourself beyond your limits. Your life is worth a lot more than you think because you are capable of accomplishing more than you know. You have more potential than you think, but you will never know your full potential unless you keep challenging yourself and pushing beyond your own self imposed limits.

You will never be able to escape from your heart. So it's better to listen to what it has to say.

There is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow creatures, and feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.

To live is so startling it leaves little time for anything else.

Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free.

Don't live down to expectations. Go out there and do something remarkable.

It is the possibility that keeps me going, and though you may call me a dreamer or a fool or any other thing, I believe that anything is possible.

Your problem is how you are going to spend this one and precious life you have been issued. Whether you're going to spend it trying to look good and creating the illusion that you have power over circumstances, or whether you are going to taste it, enjoy it and find out the truth about who you are.

If we will be quiet and ready enough, we shall find compensation in every disappointment.

The best relationships in our lives are the best not because they have been the happiest ones, they are that way because they have stayed strong through the most tormentful of storms.

So tonight I reach for my journal again. This is the first time Iâve done this since I came to Italy. What I write in my journal is that I am weak and full of fear. I explain that Depression and Loneliness have shown up, and Iâm scared they will never leave. I say that I donât want to take the drugs anymore, but Iâm frightened I will have to. I am terrified that I will never really pull my life together. 
	In response, somewhere from within me, rises a now-familiar presence, offering me all the certainties I have always wished another person would say to me when I was troubled. This is what I find myself writing on the page:
Iâm here. I love you. I donât care if you need to stay up crying all night long. I will stay with you. If you need the medication again, go ahead and take itâI will love you through that, as well. If you donât need the medication, I will love you, too. Thereâs nothing you can ever do to lose my love. I will protect you until you die, and after your death I will still protect you. I am stronger than Depression and Braver than Loneliness and nothing will ever exhaust me. 
Tonight, this strange interior gesture of friendshipâthe lending of a hand from
me to myself when nobody else is around to offer solaceâreminds me of something that happened to me once in New York City. I walked into an office building one afternoon in a hurry, dashed into the waiting elevator. As I rushed in, I caught an unexpected glance of myself in a security mirrorâs reflection. In that moment, my brain did an odd thingâit fired off this split-second message: âHey! You know her! Thatâs a friend of yours!â And I actually ran forward toward my own reflection with a smile, ready to welcome that girl whose name I had lost but whose face was so familiar. In a flash instant of course, I realized my mistake and laughed in embarrassment at my almost doglike confusion over how a mirror works. But for some reason that incident comes to mind again tonight during my sadness in Rome, and I find myself writing this comforting reminder at the bottom of the page. 
Never forget that once upon a time, in an unguarded moment, you recognized yourself as a FRIENDâ¦
	I fell asleep holding my notebook pressed against my chest, open to this most recent assurance. In the morning when I wake up, I can still smell a faint trace of depressionâs lingering smoke, but he himself is nowhere to be seen. Somewhere during the night, he got up and left. And his buddy loneliness beat it, too.

Try again. Fail again. Fail better.

Before, I wanted to say: "I found love!" But now, I want to say: "I found a person. And he belongs to me and I belong to him.

Nothing will work unless you do.

The way I see it, if you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain!

We are all worms, But I do believe that I am a glow worm.

I want to thank you, Lord, for life and all that's in it. 
Thank you for the day and for the hour, and the minute. 

If you once forfeit the confidence of your fellow citizens, you can never regain their respect and esteem. It is true that you may fool all of the people some of the time; you can even fool some of the people all of the time; but you can't fool all of the people all of the time. -Speech at Clinton, Illinois, September 8, 1854.

...Next time you're faced with a choice, do the right thing. It hurts everyone less in the long run.

There is a legend about a bird which sings just once in its life, more sweetly than any other creature on the face of the earth. From the moment it leaves the nest it searches for a thorn tree, and does not rest until it has found one. Then, singing among the savage branches, it impales itself upon the longest, sharpest spine. And, dying, it rises above its own agony to outcarol the lark and the nightingale. One superlative song, existence the price. But the whole world stills to listen, and God in His heaven smiles. For the best is only bought at the cost of great painâ¦ Or so says the legend.

Make the most of the best and the best of the worst, and keep your standards high. Never settle for anything less than you deserve or are capable of achieving.

Things die. But they don't always stay dead. Believe me, I know.

Be yourself; no base imitator of another, but your best self. There is something which you can do better than another. Listen to the inward voice and bravely obey that. Do the things at which you are great, not what you were never made for.

When I find myself in times of trouble, mother Mary comes to me,
speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me,
speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree,
there will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is still a chance that they will see,
there will be an answer. let it be.
Let it be, let it be, .....
And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light, that shines on me,
shine until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music, mother Mary comes to me,
speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be, .....

Surround Yourself with Positive People Who Believe in Your Dreams
Distance yourself from negative people who try to lower your motivation and decrease your ambition. Create space for positive people to come into your life.
Surround yourself with positive people who believe in your dreams, encourage your ideas, support your ambitions, and bring out the best in you.

You were born to stand out, stop trying to fit in.

Stop doing what is easy or popular. Start doing what is right.

When you take control of your attitude, you take control of your life.

Change may not always bring growth, but there is no growth without change.

Enthusiasm can help you find the new doors, but it takes passion to open them. If you have a strong purpose in life, you don't have to be pushed. Your passion will drive you there.

Let go of something old that no longer serves you in order to make room for something new.

I remembered the fox. One runs the risk of crying a bit if one allows oneself to be tamed.

A rock pile ceases to be a rock pile the moment a single man contemplates it, bearing within him the image of a cathedral.

The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need men who can dream of things that never were.

The only limits for tomorrow are the doubts we have today.

Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love.

I don't fit into any stereotypes. And I like myself that way.

Time weighs down on you like an old, ambiguous dream. You keep on moving, trying to sleep through it. But even if you go to the ends of the earth, you won't be able to escape it. Still, you have to go there- to the edge of the world. There's something you can't do unless you get there.

I hated every minute of training, but I said, 'Don't quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion'.

He who would learn to fly one day must first learn to walk and run and climb and dance; one cannot fly into flying. 

E.L. Doctorow said once said that 'Writing a novel is like driving a car at night. You can see only as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.' You don't have to see where you're going, you don't have to see your destination or everything you will pass along the way. You just have to see two or three feet ahead of you. This is right up there with the best advice on writing, or life, I have ever heard.

She lacks confidence, she craves admiration insatiably. She lives on the reflections of herself in the eyes of others. She does not dare to be herself.

Great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small things brought together.

Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today.

Sometimes you can see things happen right in front of your eyes and still jump to the wrong conclusions.

If a man is to shed the light of the sun upon other men, he must first of all have it within himself.

An eye is meant to see things.
The soul is here for its own joy.
A head has one use: For loving a true love.
Feet: To chase after.
Love is for vanishing into the sky. The mind,
for learning what men have done and tried to do.
Mysteries are not to be solved: The eye goes blind
when it only wants to see why.
A lover is always accused of something.
But when he finds his love, whatever was lost
in the looking comes back completely changed.

Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful.

Love is too precious to be ashamed of.

Stay hungry. Stay foolish.

When you judge another, you do not define them, you define yourself.

When you have exhausted all possibilities, remember this - you haven't.

Each person deserves a day away in which no problems are confronted, no solutions searched for.

It is not the failure of others to appreciate your abilities that should trouble you, but rather your failure to appreciate theirs.

The one who falls and gets up is stronger than the one who never tried. Do not fear failure but rather fear not trying.

Hate looks like everybody else until it smiles

Nothing's perfect, the world's not perfect. But it's there for us, trying the best it can; that's what makes it so damn beautiful.

Once you learn to quit, it becomes a habit.

To learn something new, you need to try new things and not be afraid to be wrong.

The comfort zone is a psychological state in which one feels familiar, safe, at ease, and secure. You never change your life until you step out of your comfort zone; change begins at the end of your comfort zone.

What other people think and say about you is none of your business. The most destructive thing you would ever do is to believe someone else's opinion of you. You have to stop letting other people's opinions control you.

The three great essentials to achieve anything worthwhile are, first, hard work; second, stick-to-itiveness; third, common sense.

What you are is God's gift to you, what you become is your gift to God.

This is my simple religion. There is no need for temples; no need for complicated philosophy. Our own brain, our own heart is our temple; the philosophy is kindness.

There is no passion to be found playing small - in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living.

You are willing to die, you coward, but not to live.

Feet, what do I need them for
If I have wings to fly.

I didn't come here of my own accord, and I can't leave that way.
Whoever brought me here will have to take me home.

In school we learn that mistakes are bad, and we are punished for making them. Yet, if you look at the way humans are designed to learn, we learn by making mistakes. We learn to walk by falling down. If we never fell down, we would never walk.

You need to find a way to live your life, that it doesn't make a mockery of your values.

Never respond to an angry person with a fiery comeback, even if he deserves it...Don't allow his anger to become your anger.

Scars are just another kind of memory.

Difficulties strengthen the mind, as labor does the body.

They laugh at me because I'm different; I laugh at them because they're all the same.

Never, ever, let anyone tell you what you can and can't do. Prove the cynics wrong. Pity them for they have no imagination. The sky's the limit. Your sky. Your limit. Now. Let's dance.

Pointing to another world will never stop vice among us; shedding light over this world can alone help us.

May Light always surround you;
Hope kindle and rebound you.
May your Hurts turn to Healing;
Your Heart embrace Feeling.
May Wounds become Wisdom;
Every Kindness a Prism.
May Laughter infect you;
Your Passion resurrect you.
May Goodness inspire 
your Deepest Desires.
Through all that you Reach For, 
May your arms Never Tire.

...there ain't no journey what don't change you some.

And that's when I understand that I have been stained. Whether I'm still in love with him, whether he was ever in love with me, and no matter who he's in love with now, Willem changed my life. He showed me how to get lost, and then I showed myself how to get found.

Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are.

If you havenât the strength to impose your own terms upon life, then you must accept the terms it offers you.

To care about your outward appearance is important, but whatâs more important is to have a beautiful soul.

Besides, the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters. We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are.

I am always doing what I cannot do yet, in order to learn how to do it.

You will never follow your own inner voice until you clear up the doubts in your mind.

Maybe this is why we read, and why in moments of darkness we return to books: to find words for what we already know.

God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.

If you have to dry the dishes 
(Such an awful boring chore)
If you have to dry the dishes
('Stead of going to the store)
If you have to dry the dishes
And you drop one on the floor
Maybe they won't let you
Dry the dishes anymore

Great leaders can see the greatness in others when they canât see it themselves and lead them to their highest potential they donât even know.

One of the best ways to influence people is to make them feel important.

Shine your light and make a positive impact on the world; there is nothing so honorable as helping improve the lives of others.

The strength of a woman is not measured by the impact that all her hardships in life have had on her; but the strength of a woman is measured by the extent of her refusal to allow those hardships to dictate her and who she becomes.

One must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star.

Life's great happiness is to be convinced we are loved.

I began to realize how important it was to be an enthusiast in life. He taught me that if you are interested in something, no matter what it is, go at it at full speed ahead. Embrace it with both arms, hug it, love it and above all become passionate about it. Lukewarm is no good. Hot is no good either. White hot and passionate is the only thing to be.

I am seeking, I am striving, I am in it with all my heart.

When I was little and running on the race track at school, I always stopped and waited for all the other kids so we could run together even though I knew (and everybody else knew) that I could run much faster than all of them! I pretended to read slowly so I could "wait" for everyone else who couldn't read as fast as I could! When my friends were short I pretended that I was short too and if my friend was sad I pretended to be unhappy. I could go on and on about all the ways I have limited myself, my whole life, by "waiting" for people. And the only thing that I've ever received in return is people thinking that they are faster than me, people thinking that they can make me feel bad about myself just because I let them and people thinking that I have to do whatever they say I should do. My mother used to teach me "Cinderella is a perfect example to be" but I have learned that Cinderella can go fuck herself, I'm not waiting for anybody, anymore! I'm going to run as fast as I can, fly as high as I can, I am going to soar and if you want you can come with me! But I'm not waiting for you anymore.

And if my heart be scarred and burned,
The safer, I, for all I learned.

My past has not defined me, destroyed me, deterred me, or defeated me; it has only strengthened me.

Believe there is a great power silently working all things for good, behave yourself and never mind the rest.

Plant seeds of happiness, hope, success, and love; it will all come back to you in abundance. This is the law of nature.

People who lack the clarity, courage, or determination to follow their own dreams will often find ways to discourage yours. When you change for the better, the people around you will be inspired to change also....but only after doing their best to make you stop. Live your truth and don't EVER stop.

Yesterday is not ours to recover, but tomorrow is ours to win or lose.

I long to accomplish a great and noble task, but it is my chief duty to accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble.

As a single footstep will not make a path on the earth, so a single thought will not make a pathway in the mind. To make a deep physical path, we walk again and again. To make a deep mental path, we must think over and over the kind of thoughts we wish to dominate our lives.

We are all equal in the fact that we are all different. We are all the same in the fact that we will never be the same. We are united by the reality that all colours and all cultures are distinct & individual. We are harmonious in the reality that we are all held to this earth by the same gravity. We don't share blood, but we share the air that keeps us alive. I will not blind myself and say that my black brother is not different from me. I will not blind myself and say that my brown sister is not different from me. But my black brother is he as much as I am me. But my brown sister is she as much as I am me.

All men want, not something to do with, but something to do, or rather something to be.

We are afraid of losing what we have, whether it's our life or our possessions and property. But this fear evaporates when we understand that our life stories and the history of the world were written by the same hand.

I think that one of these days," he said, "you're going to have to find out where you want to go. And then you've got to start going there. But immediately. You can't afford to lose a minute. Not you.

Ãnen i-estel edain, Ãº-chebin estel anim.
(I gave Hope to the DÃºnedain, I have kept none for myself.)
(Gilraen's linnod)

Ask yourself these three questions, Tatiana Metanova, and you will know who you are. Ask: What do believe in? What do you hope for? What do you love?

The pure present is an ungraspable advance of the past devouring the future. In truth, all sensation is already memory.

Belief, like fear or love, is a force to be understood as we understand the theory of relativity and principals of uncertainty. Phenomena that determine the course of our lives. Yesterday, my life was headed in one direction. Today, it is headed in another. Yesterday, I believe I would never have done what I did today. These forces that often remake time and space, that can shape and alter who we
imagine ourselves to be, begin long before we are born and continue after we perish. Our lives and our choices, like quantum trajectories, are understood moment to moment. That each point of intersection, each encounter, suggest a new potential direction. Proposition, I have fallen in love with Luisa Rey. Is this possible? I just met her and yet, I feel like something important has happened to me.

Life's like a movie, write your own ending. Keep believing, keep pretending.

He not busy being born is busy dying.

What would you do if you weren't afraid?

Remake the world, a little at a time, each in your own corner of the world.

We can't choose our fate, but we can choose others. Be careful in knowing that.

Associate Yourself with People Who Think Positively: 
Associate yourself with people who think positively. You cannot surround yourself with negative people and expect positive outcomes.

Great Leaders Create More Leaders
Good leaders have vision and inspire others to help them turn vision into reality. Great leaders create more leaders, not followers. Great leaders have vision, share vision, and inspire others to create their own.

No one has ever achieved greatness without dreams.

No man chooses evil because it is evil; he only mistakes it for happiness, the good he seeks.

Iâve come to the conclusion that people who wear headphones while they walk, are much happier, more confident, and more beautiful individuals than someone making the solitary drudge to work without acknowledging their own interests and power.

What is now proved was once only imagined.

The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.

Everything will turn out right, the world is built on that.

Desperation is the raw material of drastic change. Only those who can leave behind everything they have ever believed in can hope to escape. 

Reality is wrong. Dreams are for the real.

You were put on this earth to achieve your greatest self, to live out your purpose, and to do it courageously.

You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.

Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.

Perfectly Imperfect
We have all heard that no two snowflakes are alike. Each snowflake takes the perfect form for the maximum efficiency and effectiveness for its journey. And while the universal force of gravity gives them a shared destination, the expansive space in the air gives each snowflake the opportunity to take their own path. They are on the same journey, but each takes a different path.
Along this gravity-driven journey, some snowflakes collide and damage each other, some collide and join together, some are influenced by wind... there are so many transitions and changes that take place along the journey of the snowflake. But, no matter what the transition, the snowflake always finds itself perfectly shaped for its journey. 
I find parallels in nature to be a beautiful reflection of grand orchestration. One of these parallels is of snowflakes and us. We, too, are all headed in the same direction. We are being driven by a universal force to the same destination. We are all individuals taking different journeys and along our journey, we sometimes bump into each other, we cross paths, we become altered... we take different physical forms. But at all times we too are 100% perfectly imperfect. At every given moment we are absolutely perfect for what is required for our journey. Iâm not perfect for your journey and youâre not perfect for my journey, but Iâm perfect for my journey and youâre perfect for your journey. Weâre heading to the same place, weâre taking different routes, but weâre both exactly perfect the way we are. 
Think of what understanding this great orchestration could mean for relationships. Imagine interacting with others knowing that they too each share this parallel with the snowflake. Like you, they are headed to the same place and no matter what they may appear like to you, they have taken the perfect form for their journey. How strong our relationships would be if we could see and respect that we are all perfectly imperfect for our journey.

Stop feeling sorry for yourself and you will be happy.

Each suburban wife struggles with it alone. As she made the beds, shopped for groceries, matched slipcover material, ate peanut butter sandwiches with her children, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies, lay beside her husband at night- she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question-- 'Is this all?

If you can't run, you crawl. If you can't crawl-- you find someone to carry you.

It only takes a split second to smile and forget, yet to someone that needed it, it can last a lifetime.

Life is a gift. Don't forget to live it.

To truly laugh, you must be able to take your pain, and play with it.

When a stargirl cries, she sheds not tears but light.

The world is so empty if one thinks only of mountains, rivers & cities; but to know someone who thinks & feels with us, & who, though distant, is close to us in spirit, this makes the earth for us an inhabited garden.

Fair means everyone gets what they need. And the only way to get what you need is to make it happen yourself.

The only difference between you and God is that you have forgotten you are divine.

We all have two lives. The second one starts when we realize that we only have one.

As is a tale, so is life: not how long it is, but how good it is, is what matters.

Somehow I can't believe that there are any heights that can't be scaled by a man who knows the secrets of making dreams come true. This special secret, it seems to me, can be summarized in four Cs. They are curiosity, confidence, courage, and constancy, and the greatest of all is confidence. When you believe in a thing, believe in it all the way, implicitly and unquestionable.

Nothing ever really goes away--it just changes into something else. Something beautiful.

You are not a victim. No matter what you have been through, you're still here. You may have been challenged, hurt, betrayed, beaten, and discouraged, but nothing has defeated you. You are still here! You have been delayed but not denied. You are not a victim, you are a victor. You have a history of victory.

Dream your own dreams, achieve your own goals. Your journey is your own and unique.

Fear robs you of your freedom to make the right choice in life that can bridge the gap between where you are and where you want to be. On the other side of fear, lies freedom. If you want to grow, you need to be brave and take risks. If you're not uncomfortable, you're not growing.

Stay strong, stay positive, and never give up.

Wasn't that the point of the book? For women to realize, We are just two people. Not that much separates us. Not nearly as much as I'd thought.

LAW 4 
Always Say Less Than Necessary 
When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, and sphinxlike. Powerful people impress and intimidate by saying less. The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish.

I know because I read...Your mind is not a cage. It's a garden. And it requires cultivating.

Words can never fully say what we want them to say, for they fumble, stammer, and break the best porcelain. The best one can hope for is to find along the way someone to share the path, content to walk in silence, for the heart communes best when it does not try to speak.

Gossip is just a tool to distract people who have nothing better to do from feeling jealous of those few of us still remaining with noble hearts.

We cannot be sure of having something to live for unless we are willing to die for it.

I'm going to paraphrase Thoreau here... rather than love, than money, than faith, than fame, than fairness... give me truth. 

I don't paint dreams or nightmares, I paint my own reality.

I would rather make mistakes in kindness and compassion than work miracles in unkindness and hardness.

Hearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world.

If we all did the things we are really capable of doing, we would literally astound ourselves.

Want to keep Christ in Christmas? Feed the hungry, clothe the naked, forgive the guilty, welcome the unwanted, care for the ill, love your enemies, and do unto others as you would have done unto you.

Love. Fall in love and stay in love. Write only what you love, and love what you write. The word is love. You have to get up in the morning and write something you love, something to live for.

Itâs strange how dreams get under your skin and give your heart a test for whatâs real and whatâs imaginary.

It doesn't matter if a million people tell you what you can't do, or if ten million tell you no. If you get one yes from God that's all you need.

I don't want to live in the kind of world where we don't look out for each other. Not just the people that are close to us, but anybody who needs a helping hand. I cant change the way anybody else thinks, or what they choose to do, but I can do my bit.

Do you know what you are?
You are a manuscript oÆ a divine letter.
You are a mirror reflecting a noble face. 
This universe is not outside of you. 
Look inside yourself;
everything that you want, 
you are already that.

Drink your tea slowly and reverently, as if it is the axis on which the world earth revolves - slowly, evenly, without rushing toward the future.

Would you rather live one perfect day over and over or live your life with no perfect days but just decent ones?

Self-respect is the root of discipline: The sense of dignity grows
with the ability to say no to oneself.

Your time is way too valuable to be wasting on people that can't accept who you are.

You can love a person dear to you with a human love, but an enemy can only be loved with divine love.

In prayer it is better to have a heart without words than words without a heart. 

Happiness is always there. You just have to choose to see it. There's no point dwelling in the dark and ignoring the light of the stars.

According to Aristophanes in Plato's The Banquet, in the ancient world of legend there were three types of people.
In ancient times people weren't simply male or female, but one of three types : male/male, male/female or female/female. In other words, each person was made out of the components of two people. Everyone was happy with this arrangment and never really gave it much thought. But then God took a knife and cut everyone in half, right down the middle. So after that the world was divided just into male and female, the upshot being that people spend their time running around trying to locate their missing half.

Don't give up the fight,
Stand up for your rights.

If you can't you must, and if you must you can.

Iâve had many enemies over the years. If thereâs one thing Iâve learned, itâs never engage in a fight youâre sure to lose. On the other hand, never let anyone who has insulted you get away with it. Bide your time and strike back when youâre in a position of strengthâeven if you no longer need to strike back.

Life teaches us the right path is rarely the easy one.

You can have everything you want if you can put your heart and soul into everything you do.

Go and make interesting mistakes, make amazing mistakes, make glorious and fantastic mistakes. Break rules. Leave the world more interesting for your being here.

When defeat comes, accept it as a signal that your plans are not sound, rebuild those plans, and set sail once more toward your coveted goal.

Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark.

This life is for loving, sharing, learning, smiling, caring, forgiving, laughing, hugging, helping, dancing, wondering, healing, and even more loving. I choose to live life this way. I want to live my life in such a way that when I get out of bed in the morning, the devil says, 'aw shit, he's up!

There is no need to search; achievement leads to nowhere. It makes no difference at all, so just be happy now! Love is the only reality of the world, because it is all One, you see. And the only laws are paradox, humor and change. There is no problem, never was, and never will be. Release your struggle, let go of your mind, throw away your concerns, and relax into the world. No need to resist life, just do your best. Open your eyes and see that you are far more than you imagine. You are the world, you are the universe; you are yourself and everyone else, too! It's all the marvelous Play of God. Wake up, regain your humor. Don't worry, just be happy. You are already free!

But beauty is about finding the right fit, the most natural fit, To be perfect, you have to feel perfect about yourself --- avoid trying to be something you're not. For a goddess, that's especially hard. We can change so easily.
-Aphrodite

It is truth that liberates, not your effort to be free.

Your sacred space is where you can find yourself over and over again.

Every man is more than just himself; he also represents the unique, the very special and always significant and remarkable point at which the world's phenomena intersect, only once in this way, and never again. That is why every man's story is important, eternal, sacred; that is why every man, as long as he lives and fulfills the will of nature, is wondrous, and worthy of consideration. In each individual the spirit has become flesh, in each man the creation suffers, within each one a redeemer is nailed to the cross.

A villain is just a victim whose story hasnât been told.

Sometimes, as we're stumbling along in the dark, we hit something good.

And I thought that all those little kids are going to grow up someday. And all of those little kids are going to do the things that we do. And they will all kiss someone someday. But for now, sledding is enough. I think it would be great if sledding were always enough, but it isn't.

Makakapili ka ng lugar na uupuan mo, pero hindi mo mapipili ang taong uupo sa puwang sa tabi mo... Ganyan ang senaryo sa bus. Ganyan din sa pag-ibig... Lalong 'di mo kontrolado kung kelan siya bababa.

Awake, arise or be for ever fallân.

I choose gentleness... Nothing is won by force. I choose to be gentle. If I raise my voice may it be only in praise. If I clench my fist, may it be only in prayer. If I make a demand, may it be only of myself.

I am who I am; no more, no less.

Indeed, learning to write may be part of learning to read. For all I know, writing comes out of a superior devotion to reading.

Only the gentle are ever really strong.

Be a lamp, or a lifeboat, or a ladder. Help someone's soul heal. Walk out of your house like a shepherd.

If you want to build a ship, donât drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.

Anything is possible. Anything can be.

I think the act of reading imbues the reader with a sensitivity toward the outside world that people who don't read can sometimes lack. I know it seems like a contradiction in terms; after all reading is such a solitary, internalizing act that it appears to represent a disengagement from day-to-day life. But reading, and particularly the reading of fiction, encourages us to view the world in new and challenging ways...It allows us to inhabit the consciousness of another which is a precursor to empathy, and empathy is, for me, one of the marks of a decent human being.

You canât go back and make a new start, but you can start right now and make a brand new ending.

Consistency is the true foundation of trust. Either keep your promises or do not make them.

Be with someone who inspires you and makes you be the best version of yourself.

You were not born on earth to please anyone; you have to live life to express yourself, not to impress someone. Don't pretend to be someone you're not, and never lose yourself in search of other people's acceptance and approval.

How much you can learn when you fail determines how far you will go into achieving your goals.

Difficulties and adversities viciously force all their might on us and cause us to fall apart, but they are necessary elements of individual growth and reveal our true potential. We have got to endure and overcome them, and move forward. Never lose hope. Storms make people stronger and never last forever.

Push your boundaries beyond the ordinary; be that âextraâ in âextraordinary.

Every choice comes with a consequence. Once you make a choice, you must accept responsibility. You cannot escape the consequences of your choices, whether you like them or not.

The soul should always stand ajar, ready to welcome the ecstatic experience.

Be silent and safe â silence never betrays you; 
Be true to your word and your work and your friend; 
Put least trust in him who is foremost to praise you,
Nor judge of a road till it draw to the end.

We should not judge people by their peak of excellence; but by the distance they have traveled from the point where they started.

The universe doesnât give you what you ask for with your thoughts - it gives you what you demand with your actions.

Be soft. Do not let the world make you hard. Do not let the pain make you hate. Do not let the bitterness steal your sweetness. Take pride that even though the rest of the world may disagree, you still believe it to be a beautiful place

No. Don't give up hope just yet. It's the last thing to go. When you have lost hope, you have lost everything. And when you think all is lost, when all is dire and bleak, there is always hope.

The tragedy of life is what dies inside a man while he lives.

Anything under God's control is never out of control.

You can't outwit fate by standing on the sidelines placing little sidebets about the outcome of life. either you wade in and risk everything you have to play the game or you don't play at all. and if u don't play u can't win.

The butterfly counts not months but moments, and has time enough.

Intellectual growth should commence at birth and cease only at death.

What the caterpillar calls the end of the world, the master calls a butterfly.

The greatest discovery of any generation is that a human can alter his life by altering his attitude.

If you really want to do something, you'll find a way. If you don't, you'll find an excuse.

You must accept the reality of other people. You think that reality is up for negotiation, that we think it's whatever you say it is. You must accept that we are as real as you are; you must accept that you are not God.

It's funny how, in this journey of life, even though we may begin at different times and places, our paths cross with others so that we may share our love, compassion, observations, and hope. This is a design of God that I appreciate and cherish.

Written words can also sing.

I love you, in my mind where my thoughts reside, in my heart where my emotions live, and in my soul where my dreams are born. I love you.

Sticking feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken!

Jamie: You know what I figured out today?
Landon: What?
Jamie: Maybe God has a bigger plan for me than I had for myself. Like this journey never ends. Like you were sent to me because I'm sick. To help me through all this. You're my angel.

The right thing at the wrong tme is the wrong thing.

There is nothing more beautiful than seeing a person being themselves. Imagine going through your day being unapologetically you.

One mistake does not have to rule a person's entire life.

it is impossible to build one's own happiness on the unhappiness of others. This perspective is at the heart of Buddhist teachings.

Live fast. Die young. Be wild. Have fun.

I have learned, that the person I have to ask for forgiveness from the most is: myself. You must love yourself. You have to forgive yourself, everyday, whenever you remember a shortcoming, a flaw, you have to tell yourself "That's just fine". You have to forgive yourself so much, until you don't even see those things anymore. Because that's what love is like.

You know what I can't understand? You have all these people telling you all the time how great you are, smart and funny and talented and all that, I mean endlessly, I've been telling you for years. So why don't you believe it? why do you think people say that stuff, Em? Do you think it's a conspiracy, people secretly ganging up to be nice about you?

a wind has blown the rain away & the sky away & all the leaves away, & the trees stand. i think i, too, have known autumn too long.

Change course, but donât give up.

Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.

Do your own thing on your own terms and get what you came here for

Donât only practice your art, but force your way into its secrets, for it and knowledge can raise men to the divine.

We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us.

Success is determined not by whether or not you face obstacles, but by your reaction to them. And if you look at these obstacles as a containing fence, they become your excuse for failure. If you look at them as a hurdle, each one strengthens you for the next.

The language of Friendship is not words, but meanings.

How should we be able to forget those ancient myths that are at the beginning of all peoples, the myths about dragons that at the last moment turn into princesses; perhaps all the dragons of our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us once beautiful and brave. Perhaps everything terrible is in its deepest being something helpless that wants help from us.
So you must not be frightened if a sadness rises up before you larger than any you have ever seen; if a restiveness, like light and cloudshadows, passes over your hands and over all you do. You must think that something is happening with you, that life has not forgotten you, that it holds you in its hand; it will not let you fall. Why do you want to shut out of your life any uneasiness, any miseries, or any depressions? For after all, you do not know what work these conditions are doing inside you.

I am a flawed person. A brook with many stones, a clear blue sky with many blackbirds. I have many shortcomings. A rainbow thatâs not long enough, a starry night with clouds. But I can only be thankful to the God who loves me just this way, and I can only be grateful to the people in my life who accept the clear blue sky with many blackbirds and who are patient with the rainbow that isnât long enough. And because of this, I am taught love, because of this I love my God, and I love these people.

Ever since happiness heard your name, it has been running through the streets trying to find you.

But what was there to say?
Only that there were tears. Only that Quietness and Emptiness fitted together like stacked spoons. Only that there was a snuffling in the hollows at the base of a lovely throat. Only that a hard honey-colored shoulder had a semicircle of teethmarks on it. Only that they held each other close, long after it was over. Only that what they shared that night was not happiness, but hideous grief.
Only that once again they broke the Love Laws. That lay down who should be loved. And how. And how much.

I try to avoid looking forward or backward, and try to keep looking upward.

Every day People straighten up the hair, why not the heart?

I wish I could've lived my life without making any wrong turns. But that's impossible. A path like that doesn't exist. We fail. We trip. We get lost. We make mistakes. And little by little, one step at a time, we push forward. It's all we can do. On our own two feet.

Don't limit a child to your own learning, for she was born in another time.

Chaos is more freedom; in fact, total freedom. But no meaning. I want to be free to act, and I also want my actions to mean something.

We dance round in a ring and suppose,
But the Secret sits in the middle and knows.

Re-examine all you have been told. Dismiss what insults your soul.

no matter how ugly the world gets or how stupid it shows me it is, I always have faith

A man who does not think for himself does not think at all.

Don't marry a rich man. Marry a good man. He will spend his life trying to keep you happy. No rich man can buy that!

Whatever you think, be sure it is what you think; whatever you want, be sure that is what you want; whatever you feel, be sure that is what you feel.

If I've learned one lesson from all that's happened to me, it's that there is no such thing as the biggest mistake of your existence. There's no such thing as ruining your life. Life's a pretty resilient thing, it turns out.

Done is better than perfect.

Employ your time in improving yourself by other men's writings so that you shall come easily by what others have labored hard for.

She was a beautiful dreamer. The kind of girl, who kept her head in the clouds, loved above the stars and left regret beneath the earth she walked on.

There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried.

When you're screwing up and nobody says anything to you anymore, that means they've given up on you.

Grace is the face that love wears when it meets imperfection.

We are all of us born with a letter inside us, and that only if we are true to ourselves, may we be allowed to read it before we die.

It's not about how to achieve your dreams, it's about how to lead your life, ... If you lead your life the right way, the karma will take care of itself, the dreams will come to you.

In case you never get a second chance: don't be afraid!" "And what if you do get a second chance?" "You take it!

If nature has made you for a giver, your hands are born open, and so is your heart; and though there may be times when your hands are empty, your heart is always full, and you can give things out of thatâwarm things, kind things, sweet thingsâhelp and comfort and laughterâand sometimes gay, kind laughter is the best help of all.

Life will hit you hard in the face, wait for you to get back up just so it can kick you in the stomach. But getting the wind knocked out of you is the only way to remind your lungs how much they like the taste of air.

We stood there, looking at each other, saying nothing. But it was the kind of nothing that meant everything. In his eyes, there was no trace of what had happened between us earlier and I could feel something inside me break.
So that was that. We were finally, finally over.
I looked at him, and I felt so sad, because this thought occurred to me: 'I will never look at you the same way again. I'll never be that girl again. The girl who comes running back every time you push her away, the girl who loves you anyway.'
I couldnât even be mad at him, because this was who he was. This was who heâd
always been. Heâd never lied about that. He gave and then he took away. I felt it in the pit of my stomach, the familiar ache, that lost, regretful feeling only he could give me. I never wanted to feel it again. Never, ever.
Maybe this was why I came, so I could really know. So I could say good-bye.
I looked at him, and I thought, 'If I was very brave or very honest, I would tell him.'
I would say it, so he would know it and I would know it, and I could never take it back. But I wasnât that brave or honest, so all I did was look at him. And I think he knew anyway.
'I release you. I evict you from my heart. Because if I don't do it now, I never will.'
I was the one to look away first.

She had become accustomed to being lonely. She was used to walking alone and to being considered 'different.' She did not suffer too much.

Yes, I understand why things had to happen this way. I understand his reason for causing me pain. But mere understanding does not chase away the hurt. It does not call upon the sun when dark clouds have loomed over me. Let the rain come then if it must come! And let it wash away the dust that hurt my eyes!

Look at children. Of course they may quarrel, but generally speaking they do not harbor ill feelings as much or as long as adults do. Most adults have the advantage of education over children, but what is the use of an education if they show a big smile while hiding negative feelings deep inside? Children donÂt usually act in such a manner. If they feel angry with someone, they express it, and then it is finished. They can still play with that person the following day.

The key to your happiness is to own your slippers, own who you are, own how you look, own your family, own the talents you have, and own the ones you don't. If you keep saying your slippers aren't yours, then you'll die searching, you'll die bitter, always feeling you were promised more. Not only our actions, but also our omissions, become our destiny.

Don't find fault, find a remedy; anybody can complain

When you take risks you learn that there will be times when you succeed and there will be times when you fail, and both are equally important.

Men build too many walls and not enough bridges.

Laughter is carbonated holiness.

Wahai, wanita-wanita yang hingga usia tiga puluh, empat puluh, atau lebih dari itu, tapi belum juga menikah (mungkin kerana kekurangan fizikal, tidak ada kesempatan, atau tidak pernah 'terpilih' di dunia yang amat keterlaluan mencintai harta dan penampilan wajah.) Yakinlah, wanita-wanita solehah yang sendiri, namun tetap mengisi hidupnya dengan indah, bersedekah dan berkongsi, berbuat baik dan bersyukur. Kelak di hari akhir sungguh akan menjadi bidadari-bidadari syurga. Dan khabar baik itu pastilah benar, bidadari syurga parasnya cantik luar biasa.

Every person, all the events of your life are there because you have drawn them there. What you choose to do with them is up to you.

Always forgive, but never forget, else you will be a prisoner of your own hatred, and doomed to repeat your mistakes forever.

If we had no winter, the spring would not be so pleasant: if we did not sometimes taste of adversity, prosperity would not be so welcome."

It is worse to stay where one does not belong at all than to wander about lost for a while and looking for the psychic and soulful kinship one requires

Love demands everything, they say, but my love demands only this: that no matter what happens or how long it takes, you`ll keep faith in me, you`ll remember who we are, and you`ll never feel despair.

I believe in the immeasurable power of love; that true love can endure any circumstance and reach across any distance.

Love art in yourself, and not yourself in art.

We could never learn to be brave and patient if there were only joy in the world

Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp,
Or what's a heaven for?

Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.

Dream, Dream Dream
Dreams transform into thoughts 
And thoughts result in action.

You have to, take a deep breath. and allow the music to flow through you. Revel in it, allow yourself to awe. When you play allow the music to break your heart with its beauty.

What we do see depends mainly on what we look for. ... In the same field the farmer will notice the crop, the geologists the fossils, botanists the flowers, artists the colouring, sportmen the cover for the game. Though we may all look at the same things, it does not all follow that we should see them.

Failures are the stairs we climb to reach success.

No matter how much experience you have, thereâs always something new you can learn and room for improvement.

Do not let your negative thoughts have power over you because those thoughts will end up controlling your life. No one can live a positive life with a negative mind.

Just because you fall once, doesn't mean you're fall at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always trust yourself, because if you don't then who will??

Step follows step,
Hope follows Courage,
Set your face towards danger,
Set your heart on victory.

Knowing is not enough, we must apply. Willing is not enough, we must do.

Mr. Franz, I think careers are a 20th century invention and I don't want one.

There is no limit to the amount of good you can do if you don't care who gets the credit.

Determine never to be idle. No person will have occasion to complain of the want of time, who never loses any. It is wonderful how much may be done, if we are always doing.

It did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by lifeâdaily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.

God turns you from one feeling to another and teaches by means of opposites so that you will have two wings to fly, not one

Do your best and let God do the rest.

First you jump off the cliff and build your wings on the way down.

Have you ever seen the stars in the night? See them closely, they will tell you, how to be open, how to love and how to shine and twinkle without any differences and jealousy of other stars.

How would your life be different ifâ¦You stopped worrying about things you canât control and started focusing on the things you can? Let today be the dayâ¦You free yourself from fruitless worry, seize the day and take effective action on things you can change.

So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservatism, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun.

You should never assume. You know what happens when you assume. You make an ass out of you and me because that's how it's spelled.

Conquer the angry one by not getting angry; conquer the wicked by goodness; conquer the stingy by generosity, and the liar by speaking the truth.

Have regular hours for work and play; make each day both useful and pleasant, and prove that you understand the worth of time by employing it well. Then youth will bring few regrets, and life will become a beautiful success.

Instead of committing suicide, people go to work.

I think joy and sweetness and affection are a spiritual path. We're here to know God, to love and serve God, and to be blown away by the beauty and miracle of nature. You just have to get rid of so much baggage to be light enough to dance, to sing, to play. You don't have time to carry grudges; you don't have time to cling to the need to be right.

Believe in yourself and there will come a day when others will have no choice but to believe with you.

Seize the moments of happiness, love and be loved! That is the only reality in the world, all else is folly. It is the one thing we are interested in here.

May I share with you a formula that in my judgment will help you and help me to journey well through mortality... First, fill your mind with truth; second, fill your life with service; and third, fill your heart with love.

If you're not comfortable enough with yourself or with your own truth when entering a relationship, then you're not ready for that relationship.

Give up to grace. The ocean takes care of each wave 'til it gets to shore. You need more help than you know.

There comes a time when we realize that our parents cannot save themselves or save us, that everyone who wades through time eventually gets dragged out to sea by the undertow- that, in short, we are all going.

If you give up what you want most for what you think you should want more, you'll end up miserable.

The most important thing in life is to stop saying 'I wish' and start saying 'I will.' Consider nothing impossible, then treat possiblities as probabilities.

Create a vision for the life you really want and then work relentlessly towards making it a reality.

Be where you are, stop over-thinking, and focus on what you are doing.

There is no more profitable investment than investing in yourself. It is the best investment you can make; you can never go wrong with it. It is the true way to improve yourself to be the best version of you and lets you be able to best serve those around you.

I am always doing that which I can not do, in order that I may learn how to do it.

Itâs dark because you are trying too hard. 
Lightly child, lightly. Learn to do everything lightly. 
Yes, feel lightly even though youâre feeling deeply. 
Just lightly let things happen and lightly cope with them. 
I was so preposterously serious in those days, such a humorless little prig. 
Lightly, lightly â itâs the best advice ever given me. 
When it comes to dying even. Nothing ponderous, or portentous, or emphatic. 
No rhetoric, no tremolos, 
no self conscious persona putting on its celebrated imitation of Christ or Little Nell. 
And of course, no theology, no metaphysics. 
Just the fact of dying and the fact of the clear light. 
So throw away your baggage and go forward. 
There are quicksands all about you, sucking at your feet, 
trying to suck you down into fear and self-pity and despair. 
Thatâs why you must walk so lightly. 
Lightly my darling, 
on tiptoes and no luggage, 
not even a sponge bag, 
completely unencumbered.

To write well, express yourself like the common people, but think like a wise man.

It's just that in the Deep South, women learn at a young age that when the world is falling apart around you, it's time to take down the drapes and make a new dress.

To be in your children's memories tomorrow,
You have to be in their lives today.

If I must fall, may it be from a high place.

My heart might be bruised, but it will recover and become capable of seeing beauty of life once more. It's happened before, it will happen again, I'm sure. When someone leaves, it's because someone else is about to arrive--I'll find love again.

Every morning when I wake up, I experience an exquisite joy âthe joy of being Salvador DalÃ­â and I ask myself in rapture: What wonderful things is this Salvador DalÃ­ going to accomplish today?

Looking at beauty in the world, is the first step of purifying the mind.

Life is wasted on the living.

Love the trees until their leaves fall off, then encourage them to try again next year.

You have to love dancing to stick to it. It gives you nothing back, no manuscripts to store away, no paintings to show on walls and maybe hang in museums, no poems to be printed and sold, nothing but that single fleeting moment when you feel alive.


It takes a huge effort to free yourself from memory

It doesn't matter what you do...so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that's like you after you take your hands away.

The greatest step towards a life of simplicity is to learn to let go.

What saves a man is to take a step. Then another step.

Everyone has his own reality in which, if one is not too cautious, timid or frightened, one swims. This is the only reality there is.

...even a tiny bit of deceit is dishonorable when it's used for selfish or cowardly reasons.
- Mr. Penderwick

But the effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.

Love those you hate you.

Berhenti bercita-cita adalah tragedi terbesar dalam hidup manusia

Those with a grateful mindset tend to see the message in the mess. And even though life may knock them down, the grateful find reasons, if even small ones, to get up.

You know, the mind is a remarkable thing. Just because you can't see the wound doesn't mean it isn't hurting. It scars all the time, but it heals.

I cannot compromise my respect for your love. You can keep your love, I will keep my respect.

Take wrong turns. Talk to strangers. Open unmarked doors. And if you see a group of people in a field, go find out what they are doing. Do things without always knowing how they'll turn out. You're curious and smart and bored, and all you see is the choice between working hard and slacking off. There are so many adventures that you miss because you're waiting to think of a plan. To find them, look for tiny interesting choices. And remember that you are always making up the future as you go.

I was born into BolÃ­var's labyrinth, and so I must believe in the hope of Rabelais' Great Perhaps.

Life is painful. It has thorns, like the stem of a rose. Culture and art are the roses that bloom on the stem. The flower is yourself, your humanity. Art is the liberation of the humanity inside yourself.

Today is a new day. Don't let your history interfere with your destiny! Let today be the day you stop being a victim of your circumstances and start taking action towards the life you want. You have the power and the time to shape your life. Break free from the poisonous victim mentality and embrace the truth of your greatness. You were not meant for a mundane or mediocre life!

Tolerance of intolerance is cowardice.

Your Life Is Happening Right Now: Don't let procrastination take over your life. Be brave and take risks. Your life is happening right now.

The best way to measure how much you've grown isn't by inches or the number of laps you can now run around the track, or even your grade point average-- though those things are important, to be sure. It's what you've done with your time, how you've chosen to spend your days, and whom you've touched this year. That, to me, is the greatest measure of success.

People have only as much liberty as they have the intelligence to want and the courage to take.

The first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit. The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are.

Education is teaching our children to desire the right things.

Free at last, Free at last, Thank God almighty we are free at last.

Just because someone desires you, it does not mean that they value you.
Read it over.
Again.
Let those words resonate in your mind.

Frustration and Love canât exist in the same place at the same time, so get real and start doing what you would rather be doing in life. Love your life. All of it. Even the heavy shit that happened to you when you were 8. All of it was and IS perfect.

I hate you."
I love you."
You're a freak, you know that? Everyone says so. They always have."
I'm trying not to be.

When I was alive, I believed â as you do â that time was at least as real and solid as myself, and probably more so. I said 'one o'clock' as though I could see it, and 'Monday' as though I could find it on the map; and I let myself be hurried along from minute to minute, day to day, year to year, as though I were actually moving from one place to another. Like everyone else, I lived in a house bricked up with seconds and minutes, weekends and New Year's Days, and I never went outside until I died, because there was no other door. Now I know that I could have walked through the walls. (...) You can strike your own time, and start the count anywhere. When you understand that â then any time at all will be the right time for you.

Every time you do a good deed you shine the light a little farther into the dark. And the thing is, when you're gone that light is going to keep shining on, pushing the shadows back.

Remind thyself, in the darkest moments, that every failure is only a step toward success, every detection of what is false directs you toward what is true, every trial exhausts some tempting form of error, and every adversity will only hide, for a time, your path to peace and fulfillment. 

If it sounds like writing, I rewrite it.

We forfeit three-fourths of ourselves in order to be like other people.

The deepest secret is that life is not a process of discovery, but a process of creation. You are not discovering yourself, but creating yourself anew. Seek therefore, not to find out Who You Are, but seek to determine Who You Want to Be.

Life is short. If you doubt me, ask a butterfly. Their average life span is a mere five to fourteen days.

My heart, which is so full to overflowing, has often been solaced and refreshed by music when sick and weary.

I've had it with being nice, understanding, fair and hopeful. I feel like being negative all day. The chip on my shoulder could sink the QE2. I've got an attitude problem and nobody better get in my way...I'm in a bad mood and the whole stupid little world is gonna pay!

Passion is a feeling that tells you: this is the right thing to do. Nothing can stand in my way. It doesn't matter what anyone else says. This feeling is so good that it cannot be ignored. I'm going to follow my bliss and act upon this glorious sensation of joy.

do not look for healing
at the feet of those
who broke you

Children betrayed their parents by becoming their own people.

When you lose your smile, you lose your way in the chaos of life.

Your daughter is ugly.
She knows loss intimately,
carries whole cities in her belly.
As a child, relatives wouldnât hold her.
She was splintered wood and sea water.
They said she reminded them of the war.
On her fifteenth birthday you taught her
how to tie her hair like rope 
and smoke it over burning frankincense.
You made her gargle rosewater
and while she coughed, said
macaanto girls like you shouldnât smell
of lonely or empty.
You are her mother.
Why did you not warn her,
hold her like a rotting boat
and tell her that men will not love her
if she is covered in continents,
if her teeth are small colonies,
if her stomach is an island
if her thighs are borders?
What man wants to lay down 
and watch the world burn 
in his bedroom? 
Your daughterâs face is a small riot,
her hands are a civil war,
a refugee camp behind each ear,
a body littered with ugly things
but God, 
doesnât she wear
the world well.

We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, handsome, talented and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be?

What did you do?â I mumble. He is just a few feet away from me now, but not close enough to hear me. As he passes me he stretches out his hand. He wraps it around my palm and squeezes. Squeezes, then lets go. His eyes are bloodshot; he is pale. âWhat did you do?â This time the question tears from my throat like a growl. I throw myself toward him, struggling against Peterâs grip, though his hands chafe. âWhat did you do?â I scream. âYou die, I die tooâ Tobias looks over his shoulder at me. âI asked you not to do this. You made your decision. These are the repercussions.

As we go through life we gradually discover who we are, but the more we discover, the more we lose ourselves.

Am I weird?"
"Yeah. But so what? Everybody's weird.

No Difference
Small as a peanut,
Big as a giant,
We're all the same size
When we turn off the light.
Rich as a sultan,
Poor as a mite,
We're all worth the same
When we turn off the light.
Red, black or orange,
Yellow or white, 
We all look the same
When we turn off the light.
So maybe the way, 
To make everything right
Is for god to just reach out
And turn off the light!

Be an Encourager: When you encourage others, you boost their self-esteem, enhance their self-confidence, make them work harder, lift their spirits and make them successful in their endeavors. Encouragement goes straight to the heart and is always available. Be an encourager. Always.

To overcome fear is the quickest way to gain your self-confidence.

Be careful the stories you're telling yourself about your current circumstances; a head full of negative thoughts has no space for positive ones.

Sometimes I think my head is so big because it is so full of dreams

Life begins on the other side of despair.

The place God calls you to is the place where your deep gladness and the worldâs deep hunger meet.

I'd like to add some beauty to life," said Anne dreamily. "I don't exactly want to make people KNOW more... though I know that IS the noblest ambition... but I'd love to make them have a pleasanter time because of me... to have some little joy or happy thought that would never have existed if I hadn't been born.

Scars are not injuries, Tanner Sack. A scar is a healing. After injury, a scar is what makes you whole.

The further you go, the more you have to be proud of. At the same time, in order to come a long way, you have to be behind to begin with. IN the end, though maybe it's not how you reach a place that matters. Just that you get there at all.

The value of things is not the time they last, but the intensity with which they occur. That is why there are unforgettable moments and unique people!

Some people could look at a mud puddle and see an ocean with ships.

If you live in a past dream, you don't enjoy what is happening right now because you will always wish it to be different than it is. There is no time to miss anyone or anything because you are alive. Not enjoying what is happening right now is living in the past and being only half alive. This leads to self pity, suffering and tears.

What's most important in a friendship? Tolerance and loyalty.

Here is a rule to remember in future, when anything tempts you to feel bitter: not "This is misfortune," but "To bear this worthily is good fortune.

When your will is God's will, you will have your will.

When forever becomes a place...when forever ceases to be just a wordâ¦ when it ceases to be just a measurement of timeâ¦but instead becomes a place where soul mates can dance to the song in their hearts... that is a reflection of true love.

The greatest day in your life and mine is when we take total responsibility for our attitudes. That's the day we truly grow up.

It is not uncommon for people to spend their whole life waiting to start living.

I want to continue being crazy; living my life the way I dream it, and not the way the other people want it to be.

Never let a problem to be solved, become more important than a person to be loved.

I came to the conclusion long ago that all religions were true and that also that all had some error in them, and while I hold by my own religion, I should hold other religions as dear as Hinduism. So we can only pray, if we were Hindus, not that a Christian should become a Hindu; but our innermost prayer should be that a Hindu should become a better Hindu, a Muslim a better Muslim, and a Christian a better Christian.

If they don't like you for being yourself, be yourself even more.

There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard. 
There are not more than five primary colours, yet in combination
they produce more hues than can ever been seen.
There are not more than five cardinal tastes, yet combinations of
them yield more flavours than can ever be tasted.

Keep a little fire burning; however small, however hidden.

I am not a smart man, particularly, but one day, at long last, I stumbled from the dark woods of my own, and my family's, and my country's past, holding in my hands these truths: that love grows from the rich loam of forgiveness; that mongrels make good dogs; that the evidence of God exists in the roundness of things. This much, at least, I've figured out. I know this much is true.

If you care about something enough, you'll find a way to make it happen.

Be not angry that you cannot make others as you wish them to be, since you cannot make yourself as you wish to be.

I donât chase after anyone, If you wanna walk out of my life, then Iâll hold the fucking door open for you.

We do not remember days, we remember moments.

What if I mess up?"
"Oh, you will. You'll mess up, you'll make mistakes, you'll break things. Some you'll be able to piece together, and others you'll lose. That's all a given. But there's only one thing you have to do for me."
"What's that?"
"Stay alive long enough to mess up again.

Let go of something old that no longer serves you to make room for something new.

The truth knocks on the door and you say, "Go away, I'm looking for the truth," and so it goes away. Puzzling.

To be grateful is to recognize the Love of God in everything He has given us - and He has given us everything. Every breath we draw is a gift of His love, every moment of existence is a grace, for it brings with it immense graces from Him. 
Gratitude therefore takes nothing for granted, is never unresponsive, is constantly awakening to new wonder and to praise of the goodness of God. For the grateful person knows that God is good, not by hearsay but by experience. And that is what makes all the difference.

Do not dare not to dare.

It is not a daily increase, but a daily decrease. Hack away at the inessentials.

Are you on our side...and want to be different, or are you on that side and want to throw a football at my head!?

All the problem of women, starts with men. All the problem of men, ends with women.

With your head full of brains and your shoes full of feet, you're too smart to go down any not-so-good street.

This is the key to life: To expect everything to be given to you from above, yet to be genuinely surprised and forever grateful, when they are. Expecting all good things to be yours, while not knowing how to take anything for granted. If there may be a key in life, this is the key.

The past can't hurt you anymore. Not unless you let it. They made you into a victim, Evey. They made you into a statistic. But, that's not the real you. That's not who you are inside.

Let us live so that when we come to die even the undertaker will be sorry.

She had been given a wonderful gift: life. Sometimes it was cruelly taken away too soon, but it's what you did with it that counted, not how long it lasted.

I believe the simplest explanation is, there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realization that there probably is no heaven and no afterlife either. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe and for that, I am extremely grateful.

Why are you trying so hard to fit in when you were born to stand out?

It is not worth the while to let our imperfections disturb us always.

The second thing you have to do to be a writer is to keep on writing. Don't listen to people who tell you that very few people get published and you won't be one of them. Don't listen to your friend who says you are better that Tolkien and don't have to try any more. Keep writing, keep faith in the idea that you have unique stories to tell, and tell them. I meet far too many people who are going to be writers 'someday.' When they are out of high school, when they've finished college, after the wedding, when the kids are older, after I retire . . . That is such a trap You will never have any more free time than you do right now. So, whether you are 12 or 70, you should sit down today and start being a writer if that is what you want to do. You might have to write on a notebook while your kids are playing on the swings or write in your car on your coffee break. That's okay. I think we've all 'been there, done that.' It all starts with the writing. 

Normalness leads to sadness.

The man who writes about himself and his own time is the only man who writes about all people and all time.

The deeds you do may be the only sermon some persons will hear today

I am no king, and I am no lord,
And I am no soldier at-arms," said he.
"I'm none but a harper, and a very poor harper,
That am come hither to wed with ye."
"If you were a lord, you should be my lord,
And the same if you were a thief," said she.
"And if you are a harper, you shall be my harper,
For it makes no matter to me, to me,
For it makes no matter to me."
"But what if it prove that I am no harper?
That I lied for your love most monstrously?"
"Why, then I'll teach you to play and sing,
For I dearly love a good harp," said she.

Yes, I have tricks in my pocket, I have things up my sleeve. But I am the opposite of a stage magician. He gives you illusion that has the appearance of truth. I give you truth in the pleasant disguise of illusion.

Once upon a time, there was a wise man who used to go to the ocean to do his writing. He had a habit of walking on the beach before he began his work.
One day, as he was walking along the shore, he looked down the beach and saw a human figure moving like a dancer. He smiled to himself at the thought of someone who would dance to the day, and so, he walked faster to catch up.
As he got closer, he noticed that the figure was that of a young man, and that what he was doing was not dancing at all. The young man was reaching down to the shore, picking up small objects, and throwing them into the ocean.
He came closer still and called out "Good morning! May I ask what it is that you are doing?"
The young man paused, looked up, and replied "Throwing starfish into the ocean."
"I must ask, then, why are you throwing starfish into the ocean?" asked the somewhat startled wise man.
To this, the young man replied, "The sun is up and the tide is going out. If I don't throw them in, they'll die."
Upon hearing this, the wise man commented, "But, young man, do you not realize that there are miles and miles of beach and there are starfish all along every mile? You can't possibly make a difference!"
At this, the young man bent down, picked up yet another starfish, and threw it into the ocean. As it met the water, he said, 
"It made a difference for that one.

There is great change to be experienced once you learn the power of letting go. Stop allowing anyone or anything to control, limit, repress, or discourage you from being your true self! Today is YOURS to shape - own it - break free from people and things that poison or dilute your spirit.

Destiny is real. And she's not mild-mannered. She will come around and hit you in the face and knock you over and before you know what hit you, you're naked- stripped of everything you thought you knew and everything you thought you didn't know- and there you are! A bloody nose, bruises all over you, and naked. And it's the most beautiful thing.

Rise to the occassion which is life!

You can't find someone who doesn't want to be found.

Find the things that matter, and hold on to them, and fight for them, and refuse to let them go.

life is truly known only to those who suffer, lose, endure adversity, & stumble from defeat to defeat.

There's a hunger for stories in all of us, adults too. We need stories so much that we're even willing to read bad books to get them, if the good books won't supply them.

Being Adam Parrish was a complicated thing, a wonder of muscles and organs, synapses and nerves. He was a miracle of moving parts, a study in survival. The most important thing to Adam Parrish, though, had always been free will, the ability to be his own master.
This was the important thing.
It had always been the important thing. 
This was what it was to be Adam.

A gift is pure when it is given from the heart to the right person at the right time and at the right place, and when we expect nothing in return

One life is all we have and we live it as we believe in living it. But to sacrifice what you are and to live without belief, that is a fate more terrible than dying.

Fault always lies in the same place: with him weak enough to lay blame.

Love yourself first and everything else falls into line. Your really have to love yourself to get anything done in this world.

In times of stress, the best thing we can do for each other is to listen with our ears and our hearts and to be assured that our questions are just as important as our answers.

A dead thing can go with the stream, but only a living thing can go against it.

She made broken look beautiful
and strong look invincible.
She walked with the Universe
on her shoulders and made it
look like a pair of wings.

Facing it, always facing it, thatâs the way to get through. Face it.

I am the captain of my soul.

For Equilibrium, a Blessing:
Like the joy of the sea coming home to shore,
May the relief of laughter rinse through your soul.
As the wind loves to call things to dance,
May your gravity by lightened by grace.
Like the dignity of moonlight restoring the earth,
May your thoughts incline with reverence and respect.
As water takes whatever shape it is in,
So free may you be about who you become.
As silence smiles on the other side of what's said,
May your sense of irony bring perspective.
As time remains free of all that it frames,
May your mind stay clear of all it names.
May your prayer of listening deepen enough
to hear in the depths the laughter of god.

Consider it: every person you have ever met, every person will suffer the loss of his friends and family. All are going to lose everything they love in this world. Why would one want to be anything but kind to them in the meantime?

It does not matter how slowly you go so long as you do not stop.

I don't understand dating.. and the other things that people do.. all I know is that you ought to find the one you recognize. The one who gives you four arms, four legs, four eyes, and has the other half of your heart. There's only one of those, so what are all the other things for? Like dating?

No, our science is no illusion. But an illusion it would be to suppose that what science cannot give us we can get elsewhere.

Living well is an art that can be developed: a love of life and ability to take great pleasure from small offerings and assurance that the world owes you nothing and that every gift is exactly that, a gift. 

A path is only a path, and there is no affront, to oneself or to others, in dropping it if that is what your heart tells you . . . Look at every path closely and deliberately. Try it as many times as you think necessary. Then ask yourself alone, one question . . . Does this path have a heart? If it does, the path is good; if it doesn't it is of no use.

All changes, even the most longed for, have their melancholy; for what we leave behind us is a part of ourselves; we must die to one life before we can enter another.

The caged bird sings with a fearful trill,
of things unknown, but longed for still, 
and his tune is heard on the distant hill, 
for the caged bird sings of freedom.

Millions saw the apple fall, Newton was the only one who asked why?

We judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing, while others judge us by what we have already done.

Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.

In our world," said Eustace, "a star is a huge ball of flaming gas."
Even in your world, my son, that is not what a star is, but only what it is made of.

If you can dream it, you can do it.

The trick is to enjoy life. Don't wish away your days, waiting for better ones ahead.

A thousand words leave not the same deep impression as does a single deed.

I'm starting with the man in the mirror,
I'm asking him to change his ways;

Take a look at yourself, and then make a change!

You can have many great ideas in your head, but what makes the difference is the action. Without action upon an idea, there will be no manifestation, no results, and no reward

Every problem is a gift - without problems we would not grow.

Instead of worrying about what could go wrong, change your thoughts to what could go right. When you change the negative thought into a positive one, it eliminates the negative one.

There are some values that you should never compromise on to stay true to yourself; you should be brave to stand up for what you truly believe in even if you stand alone.

I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.

If you enter this world knowing you are loved and you leave this world knowing the same, then everything that happens in between can be dealt with.

Words save our lives, sometimes.

Happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue.

When I was a little girl, everything in the world fell into either of these two categories: wrong or right. Black or white. Now that I am an adult, I have put childish things aside and now I know that some things fall into wrong and some things fall into right. Some things are categorized as black and some things are categorized as white. But most things in the world aren't either! Most things in the world aren't black, aren't white, aren't wrong, aren't right, but most of everything is just different. And now I know that there's nothing wrong with different, and that we can let things be different, we don't have to try and make them black or white, we can just let them be grey. And when I was a child, I thought that God was the God who only saw black and white. Now that I am no longer a child, I can see, that God is the God who can see the black and the white and the grey, too, and He dances on the grey! Grey is okay.

Deciding whether or not to trust a person is like deciding whether or not to climb a tree because you might get a wonderful view from the highest branch or you might simply get covered in sap and for this reason many people choose to spend their time alone and indoors where it is harder to get a splinter.

God is subtle but he is not malicious.

I am what I am, anâ Iâm not ashamed. 'Never be ashamed,â my olâ dad used ter say, âthereâs some whoâll hold it against you, but theyâre not worth botherinâ with.

LAW 25
Re-Create Yourself
Do not accept the roles that society foists on you. Re-create yourself by forging a new identity, one that commands attention and never bores the audience. Be the master of your own image rather than letting others define if for you. Incorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures and actions â your power will be enhanced and your character will seem larger than life.

What we achieve inwardly will change outer reality.

A thing of beauty is a joy for ever: 
Its loveliness increases; it will never 
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep 
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep 
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.

I advise you to stop sharing your dreams with people who try to hold you back, even if they're your parents. Because, if you're the kind of person who senses there's something out there for you beyond whatever it is you're expected to do - if you want to be EXTRA-ordinary- you will not get there by hanging around a bunch of people who tell you you're not extraordinary. Instead, you will probably
become as ordinary as they expect you to be.

The adventure of life is to learn. The purpose of life is to grow. The nature of life is to change. The challenge of life is to overcome. The essence of life is to care. The opportunity of like is to serve. The secret of life is to dare. The spice of life is to befriend. The beauty of life is to give.

Beyond work and love, I would add two other ingredients that give meaning to life. First, to fulfill whatever talents we are born with. However blessed we are by fate with different abilities and strengths, we should try to develop them to the fullest, rather than allow them to atrophy and decay. We all know individuals who did not fulfill the promise they showed in childhood. Many of them became haunted by the image of what they might have become. Instead of blaming fate, I think we should accept ourselves as we are and try to fulfill whatever dreams are within our capability.
Second, we should try to leave the world a better place than when we entered it. As individuals, we can make a difference, whether it is to probe the secrets of Nature, to clean up the environment and work for peace and social justice, or to nurture the inquisitive, vibrant spirit of the young by being a mentor and a guide.

Before I go," he said, and paused -- "I may kiss her?"
It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips, he murmured some words. The child, who was nearest to him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren when she was a handsome old lady, that she heard him say, "A life you love.

Sometimes I arrive just when God's ready to have somone click the shutter.

It's not that some people have willpower and some don't... It's that some people are ready to change and others are not.

Myth is much more important and true than history. History is just journalism and you know how reliable that is.

Champions have the courage to keep turning the pages because they know a better chapter lies ahead.

I'm not going to limit myself just because people won't accept the fact that I can do something else.

 Many of us are slaves to our minds. Our own mind is our worst enemy. We try to focus, and our mind wanders off. We try to keep stress at bay, but anxiety keeps us awake at night. We try to be good to the people we love, but then we forget them and put ourselves first. And when we want to change our life, we dive into spiritual practice and expect quick results, only to lose focus after the honeymoon has worn off. We return to our state of bewilderment. We're left feeling helpless and discouraged. It seems we all agree that training the body through exercise, diet, and relaxation is a good idea, but why don't we think about training our minds?

You've got to show the world who you are before it tells you. Otherwise you become victim to someone you're not.

Accepting oneself does not preclude an attempt to become better.

Finding one important thing in your life doesnât mean you have to
give up all the other important things.

When obstacles arise, you change your direction to reach your goal; you do not change your decision to get there.

It doesnât matter what we are. It matters what we do.

I don't know, I don't want to talk as much. (...) It's nicer to think dear, pretty thoughts and keep them in one's heart, like treasures. I don't like to have them laughed at or wondered over.

Do not wait: the time will never be 'just right'. Start where you stand, and work whatever tools you may have at your command and better tools will be found as you go along.

When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead.

Real change is difficult at the beginning. Without the familiar to rely upon, you may not in as much command as you had once been. When things are not going your way, you will start doubting yourself. Stay positive, keep the faith, and keep moving forward â your breakthrough may be just around the corner.

It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.

Travel is never a matter of money but of courage

It serves me right for putting all my eggs in one bastard.

Music is an agreeable harmony for the honor of God and the permissible delights of the soul.

The absence of the will to live is, alas, not sufficient to make one want to die.

How much time he gains who does not look to see what his neighbour says or does or thinks, but only at what he does himself, to make it just and holy.

In this sad world of ours sorrow comes to all and it often comes with bitter agony. Perfect relief is not possible except with time. You cannot now believe that you will ever feel better. But this is not true. You are sure to be happy again. Knowing this, truly believing it will make you less miserable now. I have had enough experience to make this statement.

Go for it, while you can. I know you have it in you. And I can't promise you'll get everything you want, but I can promise nothing will change if you don't try.

To those who will see, the world waits.

In the end, just three things matter:
How well we have lived
How well we have loved
How well we have learned to let go

I'm beginning to think that maybe it's not just how much you love someone. Maybe what matters is who you are when you're with them.

After sleeping through a hundred million centuries we have finally opened our eyes on a sumptuous planet, sparkling with color, bountiful with life. Within decades we must close our eyes again. Isnât it a noble, an enlightened way of spending our brief time in the sun, to work at understanding the universe and how we have come to wake up in it? This is how I answer when I am askedâas I am surprisingly oftenâwhy I bother to get up in the mornings.

Everything stinks till itâs finished.

You must expect great things of yourself before you can do them.

I keep thinking about a tale my nurse used to read to me about a bird whose wings are pinned to the ground. In the end, when he finally frees himself, he flies so high he becomes a star. My nurse said the story was about how we all have something that keeps us down.

Men and women who turn their lives over to God will discover that He can make a lot more out of their lives than they can. He can deepen their joys, expand their vision, quicken their minds, strengthen their muscles, lift their spirits, multiply their blessings, increase their opportunities, comfort their soals, and pour out peace.

Closing The Cycle
One always has to know when a stage comes to an end. If we insist on staying longer than the necessary time, we lose the happiness and the meaning of the other stages we have to go through. Closing cycles, shutting doors, ending chapters - whatever name we give it, what matters is to leave in the past the moments of life that have finished.
Did you lose your job? Has a loving relationship come to an end? Did you leave your parents' house? Gone to live abroad? Has a long-lasting friendship ended all of a sudden?
You can spend a long time wondering why this has happened. You can tell yourself you won't take another step until you find out why certain things that were so important and so solid in your life have turned into dust, just like that. But such an attitude will be awfully stressing for everyone involved: your parents, your husband or wife, your friends, your children, your sister, everyone will be finishing chapters, turning over new leaves, getting on with life, and they will all feel bad seeing you at a standstill.
None of us can be in the present and the past at the same time, not even when we try to understand the things that happen to us. What has passed will not return: we cannot for ever be children, late adolescents, sons that feel guilt or rancor towards our parents, lovers who day and night relive an affair with someone who has gone away and has not the least intention of coming back.
Things pass, and the best we can do is to let them really go away. That is why it is so important (however painful it may be!) to destroy souvenirs, move, give lots of things away to orphanages, sell or donate the books you have at home. Everything in this visible world is a manifestation of the invisible world, of what is going on in our hearts - and getting rid of certain memories also means making some room for other memories to take their place.
Let things go. Release them. Detach yourself from them. Nobody plays this life with marked cards, so sometimes we win and sometimes we lose. Do not expect anything in return, do not expect your efforts to be appreciated, your genius to be discovered, your love to be understood. Stop turning on your emotional television to watch the same program over and over again, the one that shows how much you suffered from a certain loss: that is only poisoning you, nothing else.
Nothing is more dangerous than not accepting love relationships that are broken off, work that is promised but there is no starting date, decisions that are always put off waiting for the "ideal moment." Before a new chapter is begun, the old one has to be finished: tell yourself that what has passed will never come back. Remember that there was a time when you could live without that thing or that person - nothing is irreplaceable, a habit is not a need. This may sound so obvious, it may even be difficult, but it is very important.
Closing cycles. Not because of pride, incapacity or arrogance, but simply because that no longer fits your life. Shut the door, change the record, clean the house, shake off the dust. Stop being who you were, and change into who you are.

Wait long enough and people will surprise and impress. When you're pissed off at someone and you're angry at them, you just haven't given them enough time. Just give them a little more time and they almost always will impress you.

Wrong will be right, when Aslan comes in sight,
At the sound of his roar, sorrows will be no more,
When he bares his teeth, winter meets its death,
And when he shakes his mane, we shall have spring again.

HOW 
do you define a word without concrete meaning? To each his own, the saying goes, so
WHY
push to attain an ideal state of being that no two random people will agree is
WHERE 
you want to be? Faultless. Finished. Incomparable. People can never be these, and anyway,
WHEN
did creating a flawless facade become a more vital goal than learning to love the person
WHO
lives inside your skin? The outside belongs to others. Only you should decide for you -
WHAT
is perfect.

Somehow, we'll find it. The balance between whom we wish to be and whom we need to be. But for now, we simply have to be satisfied with who we are.

The best love in the world, is the love of a man. The love of a man who came from your womb, the love of your son! I don't have a daughter, but maybe the love of a daughter is the best, too. I am first and foremost me, but right after that, I am a mother. The best thing that I can ever be, is me. But the best gift that I will ever have, is being a mother.

Kecantikan yang abadi terletak pada keelokan adab dan ketinggian ilmu seseorang. Bukan terletak pada wajah dan pakaiannya.

You could do a lot worse.

Man cannot possess anything as long as he fears death. But to him who does not fear it, everything belongs. If there was no suffering, man would not know his limits, would not know himself. 

Each of us has the right and the responsibility to assess the roads which lie ahead, and those over which we have traveled, and if the future road looms ominous or unpromising, and the roads back uninviting, then we need to gather our resolve and, carrying only the necessary baggage, step off that road into another direction. If the new choice is also unpalatable, without embarrassment, we must be ready to change that as well.

Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God.

My happiness grows in direct proportion to my acceptance, and in inverse proportion to my expectations.

You make the world a better place by making daily improvements to become the best version of yourself.

What helps you persevere is your resilience and commitment.

Never bend your head. Hold it high. Look the world straight in the eye.

That proves you are unusual," returned the Scarecrow; "and I am convinced that the only people worthy of consideration in this world are the unusual ones. For the common folks are like the leaves of a tree, and live and die unnoticed.

Always be yourself, there's no one better!

I don't know why people are afraid of lust. Then I can imagine that they are very afraid of me, for I have a great lust for everything. A lust for life, a lust for how the summer-heated street feels beneath my feet, a lust for the touch of another's skin on my skin...a lust for everything. I even lust after cake. Yes, I am very lusty and very scary.

Courage does not always roar. Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying, 'I will try again tomorrow.

Come friends, it's not too late to seek a newer world.

What if the kid you bullied at school, grew up, and turned out to be the only surgeon who could save your life?

Try, reach, want, and you may fall. But even if you do, you might be okay anyway. 
If you don't try, you save nothing, because you might as well be dead.

Because," explained Mary Rommely simply, "the child must have a valuable thing which is called imagination. The child must have a secret world in which live things that never were. It is necessary that she believe. She must start out by believing in things not of this world. Then when the world becomes too ugly for living in, the child can reach back and live in her imagination. I, myself, even in this day and at my age, have great need of recalling the miraculous lives of the Saints and the great miracles that have come to pass on earth. Only by having these things in my mind can I live beyond what I have to live for.

The harder you fall, the heavier your heart; the heavier your heart, the stronger you climb; the stronger you climb, the higher your pedestal.

No matter how hard life is, don't lose hope

It's a lie to think you're not good enough. It's a lie to think you're not worth anything.

My name is Celaena Sardothien," she whispered, "and I will not be afraid.

...Despite the mayhem that followed, Bruno found that he was still holding Shmuel's hand in his own and nothing in the world would have persuaded him to let go.

Focus on making yourself better, not on thinking that you are better.

Can you remember who you were, before the world told you who you should be?

Good works is giving to the poor and the helpless, but divine works is showing them their worth to the One who matters.

One must always be prepared for riotous and endless waves of transformation.

When men are pure, laws are useless; when men are corrupt, laws are broken.

Don't waste your energy trying to change opinions ... Do your thing, and don't care if they like it.

Those three things - autonomy, complexity, and a connection between effort and reward - are, most people will agree, the three qualities that work has to have if it is to be satisfying.

There's no limit to what you can dream. You 
 the unexpected, you 
 in magic, in fairy tales, and in possibilities. Then you grow older and that innocence is shattered and somewhere along the way the reality of 
 gets in the way and you're hit by the realization that you can't be 
 you wanted to be, you just might have to settle for a little bit less.

I agree with yours of the 22d that 
. but we cannot always do what is absolutely best. those with whom we act, entertaining different views, have the power and the right of carrying them into practice. truth advances, & error recedes step by step only; and to do to our fellow-men the most good in our power, we must lead where we can, follow where we cannot, and still go with them, watching always the favorable moment for helping them to another step.

The amazing thing is that every atom in your body came from a star that exploded. And, the atoms in your left hand probably came from a different star than your right hand. It really is the most poetic thing I know about physics: You are all stardust. You couldnât be here if stars hadnât exploded, because the elements - the carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, all the things that matter for evolution - werenât created at the beginning of time. They were created in the nuclear furnaces of stars, and the only way they could get into your body is if those stars were kind enough to explode. So, forget Jesus. The stars died so that you could be here today.

Everything you want is on the other side of fear.

Til shade is gone, 
til water is gone
Into the shadow with teeth bared
Screaming defiance with the last breath
To spit in Sightblinderâs eye on the Last Day.

Someday is now.

An idea is salvation by imagination

You have to be the bravest person in the world to go out every day, being yourself when no one likes who you are.

The great secret of true success, of true happiness, is this: the man or woman who asks for no return, the perfectly unselfish person, is the most successful.

The beauty of the world...has two edges, one of laughter, one of anguish, cutting the heart asunder.

Everything is determined, the beginning as well as the end, by forces over which we have no control. It is determined for the insect, as well as for the star. Human beings, vegetables, or cosmic dust, we all dance to a mysterious tune, intoned in the distance by an invisible piper.

Nothing's a better cure for writer's block than to eat ice cream right out of the carton.

Free yourself from the complexities and drama of your life. Simplify. Look within. Within ourselves we all have the gifts and talents we need to fulfill the purpose we've been blessed with.

I do not believe that sheer suffering teaches. If suffering alone taught, all the world would be wise, since everyone suffers. To suffering must be added mourning, understanding, patience, love, openness, and the willingness to remain vulnerable.

Everything changed the day she figured out there was exactly enough time for the important things in her life.

It is only with true love and compassion that we can begin to mend what is broken in the world. It is these two blessed things that can begin to heal all broken hearts.

Waiting for you is like waiting for rain in this drought. Useless and disappointing." ~ Sam (Hilary Duff), A Cinderella Story

If I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend, I hope I should have the guts to betray my country.

Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

It's your life-but only if you make it so.

A dog has no use for fancy cars or big homes or designer clothes. Status symbol means nothing to him. A waterlogged stick will do just fine. A dog judges others not by their color or creed or class but by who they are inside. A dog doesn't care if you are rich or poor, educated or illiterate, clever or dull. Give him your heart and he will give you his. It was really quite simple, and yet we humans, so much wiser and more sophisticated, have always had trouble figuring out what really counts and what does not. As I wrote that farewell column to Marley, I realized it was all right there in front of us, if only we opened our eyes. Sometimes it took a dog with bad breath, worse manners, and pure intentions to help us see.

Freedom is a heavy load, a great and strange burden for the spirit to undertake. It is not easy. It is not a gift given, but a choice made, and the choice may be a hard one. The road goes upward towards the light; but the laden traveler may never reach the end of it.

Not everyone 
 to be the Chosen One. Not everyone has to be the guy who saves the world. Most people just have to live their lives the best they can, doing things that are great for 
, having great friends, trying to make their lives better, loving people properly. All the while knowing that the world makes no sense but trying to find a way to be happy anyway.

Run when you can, walk if you have to, crawl if you must; just never give up.

When you say "I" and "my" too much, you lose the capacity to understand the "we" and "our".

Do not give way to useless alarm; though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.

My only regrets are the moments when i doubted myself and took the safe route. Life is too short to waste time being unhappy.

Everything that is done in this world is done by hope.

Jessica. For god's sake," he said. "Allow me to do at least one common courtesy for you. In spite ow what 'women's lib' teaches you, chivalry does not imply that women are powerless. On the contrary, chivalry is an admission of women's superiority. An acknowledgment of 
 power over 
. This is the only form of servitude a Vladescu ever practices, and I perform it gladly for you. You, in turn, are obligated to accept graciously.

According to this law [the law of Dharma], you have a unique talent and a unique way of expressing it. There is something that you can do better than anyone else in the whole world--and for every unique talent and unique expression of that talent, there are also unique needs. When these needs are matched with the creative expression of your talent, that is the spark that creates affluence. Expressing your talents to fulfill needs creates unlimited wealth and abundance.

Of all the wonders that I have heard,
It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
Seeing death, a necessary end,
Will come when it will come.
(Act II, Scene 2)

Distance can ruin even the best of intentions.
But I suppose it depends on how you look at it.
Distance just adds a richness you would not otherwise get.
People come. People go. They will drift in and out of your life, almost like characters in a favorite book.
When you finally close the cover, the characters have told their stories and you start up again with another book, complete with new characters and adventures. Then you find yourself focusing on the new ones. Not the ones from the past.

Never stop. Never stop fighting. Never stop dreaming.

What hurts us is what heals us

All human beings should try to learn before they die what they are running from, and to, and why.

If people make fun of you, that probably means you're doing something right.

The sky is the limit... for some people aim higher nothing is impossible.

There are scores of people waiting for someone just like us to come along; people who will appreciate our compassion, our encouragement, who will need our unique talents. Someone who will live a happier life merely because we took the time to share what we had to give.

You attract who you are being. When you work at being the type of person that you want to attract, you attract those kinds of people into your life.

In the end you can't always choose what to keep. You can only choose how you let it go.

These were the lovely bones that had grown around my absence: the connections-sometimes tenuous, sometimes made at great cost, but often magnificent-that happened after I was gone. And I began to see things in a way that let me hold the world without me in it. The events that my death wrought were merely the bones of a body that would become whole at some unpredictable time in the future. The price of what I came to see as this miraculous body had been my life.

Life has no victims. There are no victims in this life.
No one has the right to point fingers at his/her past and blame it for what he/she is today. We do not have the right to point our finger at someone else and blame that person for how we treat others, today.
Donât hide in the corner, pointing fingers at your past. Donât sit under the table, talking about someone who has hurt you. Instead, stand up and face your past! Face your fears! Face your pain! And stomach it all! You may have to do so kicking and screaming and throwing fits and crying- but by all means- face it!
This life makes no room for cowards.

God save us from religion.

The pessimist resembles a man who observes with fear and sadness that his wall calendar, from which he daily tears a sheet, grows thinner with each passing day. On the other hand, the person who attacks the problems of life actively is like a man who removes each successive leaf from his calendar and files it neatly and carefully away with its predecessors, after first having jotted down a few diary notes on the back. He can reflect with pride and joy on all the richness set down in these notes, on all the life he has already lived to the fullest. What will it matter to him if he notices that he is growing old? Has he any reason to envy the young people whom he sees, or wax nostalgic over his own lost youth? What reasons has he to envy a young person? For the possibilities that a young person has, the future which is in store for him?
No, thank you,' he will think. 'Instead of possibilities, I have realities in my past, not only the reality of work done and of love loved, but of sufferings bravely suffered. These sufferings are even the things of which I am most proud, although these are things which cannot inspire envy.

I have frequently seen people become neurotic when they content themselves with inadequate or wrong answers to the questions of life. They seek position, marriage, reputation, outward success of money, and remain unhappy and neurotic even when they have attained what they were seeking. Such people are usually confined within too narrow a spiritual horizon. Their life has not sufficient content, sufficient meaning. If they are enabled to develop into more spacious personalities, the neurosis generally disappears.

The opinion which other people have of you is their problem, not yours.

Somebody has to start. Somebody has to step forward and do what is right, because it is right.

The heights by great men reached and kept were not attained in sudden flight but, they while their companions slept, they were toiling upwards in the night.

You enter the forest
at the darkest point,
where there is no path.
Where there is a way or path,
it is someone else's path.
You are not on your own path.
If you follow someone else's way,
you are not going to realize
your potential.

How satisfying it is to leave a mark on a blank surface. To make a map of my movement - no matter how temporary.

Realize deeply that the present moment is all you will ever have.

Two things fill the mind with ever-increasing wonder and awe, the more often and the more intensely the mind of thought is drawn to them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.

Two wrongs don't make a right, but don't three lefts make a right? Two wrongs don't make a right, but don't two negatives make a positive?

Know from whence you came. If you know whence you came, there are absolutely no limitations to where you can go.

Your own positive future begins in this moment. All you have is right now. Every goal is possible from here.

As long as you have life and breath, believe. Believe for those who cannot. Believe even if you have stopped believing. Believe for the sake of the dead, for love, to keep your heart beating, believe. Never give up, never despair, let no mystery confound you into the conclusion that mystery cannot be yours.

Mimpi-mimpi kamu, cita-cita kamu, keyakinan kamu, apa yang kamu mau kejar, biarkan ia menggantung, mengambang 5 centimeter di depan kening kamu. Jadi dia nggak akan pernah lepas dari mata kamu. Dan kamu bawa mimpi dan keyakinan kamu itu setiap hari, kamu lihat setiap hari, dan percaya bahwa kamu bisa. 
Apa pun hambatannya, bilang sama diri kamu sendiri, kalo kamu percaya sama keinginan itu dan kamu nggak bisa menyerah. Bahwa kamu akan berdiri lagi setiap kamu jatuh, bahwa kamu akan mengejarnya sampai dapat, apapun itu, segala keinginan, mimpi, cita-cita, keyakinan diri.. 
Biarkan keyakinan kamu, 5 centimeter mengambang di depan kening kamu. Danâ¦ sehabis itu yang kamu perlu cuma kaki yang akan berjalan lebih jauh dari biasanya, tangan yang akan berbuat lebih banyak dari biasanya, mata yang akan menatap lebih lama dari biasanya, leher yang akan lebih sering melihat ke atas, lapisan tekad yang seribu kali lebih keras dari baja, dan hati yang akan bekerja lebih keras dari biasanya, serta mulut yang akan selalu berdoa..
Keep our dreams alive, and we will survive..

What we love determines what we seek. What we seek determines what we think and do. What we think and do determines who we are â and who we will become.

[BURR]
I am the one thing in life I can control.

You can't always judge people by the things they done. You got to judge them by what they are doing now.

Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.

However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.

Its more fun to think of the future than dwell on the past.

If you do what you've always done, you'll get what you've always gotten. 

There is no evidence that we've been placed on this planet to be especially happy or especially normal. And in fact our unhappiness and our strangeness, our anxieties and compulsions, those least fashionable aspects of our personalities, are quite often what lead us to do rather interesting things.

The sea's only gifts are harsh blows, and occasionally the chance to feel strong. Now I don't know much about the sea, but I do know that that's the way it is here. And I also know how important it is in life not necessarily to be strong but to feel strong. To measure yourself at least once. To find yourself at least once in the most ancient of human conditions. Facing the blind death stone alone, with nothing to help you but your hands and your own head.

If you have kindness in your heart, you offer acts of kindness to touch the hearts of others wherever you goâwhether they are random or planned. Kindness becomes a way of life.

Make the most of what you have and keep your standards high. Never settle for anything less than you deserve or are capable of achieving.

Being happy doesn't mean that everything is perfect. It means that you've decided to look beyond the imperfections.

Death, therefore, the most awful of evils, is nothing to us, seeing that, when we are, death is not come, and, when death is come, we are not.

Too much sanity may be madness â and maddest of all: to see life as it is, and not as it should be!

Give me the Love that leads the way
The Faith that nothing can dismay
The Hope no disappointments tire
The Passion that'll burn like fire
Let me not sink to be a clod
Make me Thy fuel, Flame of God

Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness. It is not attained through self-gratification but through fidelity to a worthy purpose.

To love is easy, to be in a relationship is extremely difficult.

Two years he walks the earth. No phone, no pool, no pets, no cigarettes. Ultimate freedom. An extremist. An aesthetic voyager whose home is the road. Escaped from Atlanta. Thou shalt not return, 'cause "the West is the best." And now after two rambling years comes the final and greatest adventure. The climactic battle to kill the false being within and victoriously conclude the spiritual pilgrimage. Ten days and nights of freight trains and hitchhiking bring him to the Great White North. No longer to be poisoned by civilization he flees, and walks alone upon the land to become lost in the wild.
--Alexander Supertramp, May 1992

A man may die, nations may rise and fall, but an idea lives on. Ideas have endurance without death.

It is better to be respected than it is to be popular. Popularity ends on yearbook day, but respect lasts forever.

The function of freedom is to free someone else.

If every life is a river, then it's little wonder that we do not even notice the changes that occur until we are far out in the darkest sea. One day you look around and nothing is familiar, not even your own face.
 My name once meant daughter, grandaughter, friend, sister, beloved. Now those words mean only what their letters spell out; Star in the night sky. Truth in the darkness.
I have crossed over to a place where I never thought I'd be. I am someone I would have never imagined. A secret. A dream. I am this, body and soul. Burn me. Drown me. Tell me lies. I will still be who I am.

Always tell what you feel. Do what you think...

Smile at strangers and you just might change a life.

This is your life. Do what you want and do it often. 
If you don't like something, change it. 
If you don't like your job, quit.
If you don't have enough time, stop watching TV.
If you are looking for the love of your life, stop; they will be waiting for you when you start doing things you love.
Stop over-analysing, life is simple.
All emotions are beautiful.
When you eat, appreciate every last bite.
Life is simple.
Open your heart, mind and arms to new things and people, we are united in our differences.
Ask the next person you see what their passion is and share your inspiring dream with them.
Travel often; getting lost will help you find yourself.
Some opportunities only come once, seize them.
Life is about the people you meet and the things you create with them, so go out and start creating.
Life is short, live your dream and wear your passion.

I think that I shall never see
A poem lovely as a tree.
A tree whose hungry mouth is pressed
Against the earth's sweet flowing breast;
A tree that looks at God all day
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
A tree that may in summer wear
A nest of robins in her hair;
Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
Who intimately lives with rain.
Poems are made by fools like me,
But only God can make a tree.

But we never get back our youthâ¦ The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses rot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to.

Life is a series of surprises and would not be worth taking or keeping if it were not.

Prayer is not an old woman's idle amusement. Properly understood and applied, it is the most potent instrument of action.

This place is a dream. Only a sleeper considers it real. Then death comes like dawn, and you wake up laughing at what you thought was your grief.

Although my memory's fading, I remember two things very clearly: I am a great sinner and Christ is a great Savior.

To touch the soul of another human being is to walk on holy ground.

Let us pick up our books and our pens, they are the most powerful weapons.

I want to be like Gandhi and Martin Luther King and John Lennon but i want to STAY ALIVE.

Death is the easy part, the hard part is living and knowing you could be so much more then youâre willing to be.

No great wisdom can be reached without sacrifice.

Because I trust in the ever-changing climate of the heart. (At least, today I feel that way.) I think it is necessary to have many experiences for the sake of feeling something; for the sake of being challenged, and for the sake of being expressive, to offer something to someone else, to learn what we are capable of.

Every moment of light and dark is a miracle.

How sweet is the assurance, how comforting is the peace that come from the knowledge that if we marry right and live right, our relationship will continue, notwithstanding the certainty of death and the passage of time. Men may write love songs and sing them. They may yearn and hope and dream. But all of this will be only a romantic longing unless there is an exercise of authority that transcends the powers of time and death.

After all, you can't truly be happy if you've never known pain. You can't truly feel joy if you've never felt heartbreak. You can't know what it's like to be filled unless you've been empty.

You have come a long way and have won many battles. Whenever youâre faced with a difficult or challenging situation, youâll overcome it. Yes, you can.

We lay there and looked up at the night sky and she told me about stars called blue squares and red swirls and I told her I'd never heard of them. Of course not, she said, the really important stuff they never tell you. You have to imagine it on your own.

No one is ever satisfied where he is.

I am not what I ought to be, I am not what I want to be, I am not what I hope to be in another world; but still I am not what I once used to be, and by the grace of God I am what I am

We travel, initially, to lose ourselves; and we travel, next to find ourselves. We travel to open our hearts and eyes and learn more about the world than our newspapers will accommodate. We travel to bring what little we can, in our ignorance and knowledge, to those parts of the globe whose riches are differently dispersed. And we travel, in essence, to become young fools again- to slow time down and get taken in, and fall in love once more.

All I ask is this: Do something. Try something. Speaking out, showing up, writing a letter, a check, a strongly worded e-mail. Pick a cause â there are few unworthy ones. And nudge yourself past the brink of tacit support to action. Once a month, once a year, or just once...Even just learning enough about a subject so you can speak against an opponent eloquently makes you an unusual personage. Start with that. Any one of you would have cried out, would have intervened, had you been in that crowd in Bashiqa. Well thanks to digital technology, youâre all in it now.

Wanderer, your footsteps are the road, and nothing more; wanderer, there is no road, the road is made by walking. By walking one makes the road, and upon glancing behind one sees the path that never will be trod again. Wanderer, there is no road-- Only wakes upon the sea.
Caminante, son tus huellas el camino, y nada mÃ¡s; caminante, no hay camino, se hace camino al andar. Al andar se hace camino, y al volver la vista atrÃ¡s se ve la senda que nunca se ha de volver a pisar. Caminante, no hay camino, sino estelas en la mar.

Sit down before fact as a little child, be prepared to give up every preconceived notion, follow humbly wherever and to whatever abysses nature leads, or you shall learn nothing. I have only begun to learn content and peace of mind since I have resolved at all risks to do this.

The most exquisite paradoxâ¦ as soon as you give it all up, you can have it all. As long as you want power, you can't have it. The minute you don't want power, you'll have more than you ever dreamed possible.

Nobody steals books but your friends.

Complain and remain. Praise and be raised.

With our thoughts we make the world.

People would rather believe than know.

Be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind. Talk health, happiness, and prosperity to every person you meet. Make all your friends feel there is something special in them. Look at the sunny side of everything. Think only the best, be as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own.
Forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of the future. Give everyone a smile. Spend so much time improving yourself that you have no time left to criticize others. Be too big for worry and too noble for anger.

Your complaints, your drama, your victim mentality, your whining, your blaming, and all of your excuses have NEVER gotten you even a single step closer to your goals or dreams. Let go of your nonsense. Let go of the delusion that you DESERVE better and go EARN it! Today is a new day!

Write while the heat is in you. The writer who postpones the recording of his thoughts uses an iron which has cooled to burn a hole with. He cannot inflame the minds of his audience.

You can't dwell on what might have been...and it's not fair to condemn him for something he hasn't done.

A writer must teach himself that the basest of all things is to be afraid. 

And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.

Whether a thought is spoken or not it is a real thing and it has power," Tuek said. "You might find the line between life and death among the Fremen to be too sharp and quick.

We need to help people to discover the true meaning of love. Love is generally confused with dependence. Those of us who have grown in true love know that we can love only in proportion to our capacity for independence.

If you donât like the road youâre walking, start paving another one.

If I am the pawn of the gods, it is because they know me so well, not because they make my mind up for me.

Make today worth remembering.

Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself... 
You may house their bodies but not their souls, for their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.

Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. 
Believe in yourself, your abilities and your own potential. Never let self-doubt hold you captive. You are worthy of all that you dream of and hope for.

Action springs not from thought, but from a readiness for responsibility.

If you are a dreamer come in

It is not so much the major events as the small day-to-day decisions that map the course of our living. . . Our lives are, in reality, the sum total of our seemingly unimportant decisions and of our capacity to live by those decisions.

Keep your promises and be consistent. Be the kind of person others can trust.

For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.

Jesus Christ lived in the midst of his enemies. At the end all his disciples deserted him. On the Cross he was utterly alone, surrounded by evildoers and mockers. For this cause he had come, to bring peace to the enemies of God. So the Christian, too, belongs not in the seclusion of a cloistered life but in the thick of foes. There is his commission, his work. 'The kingdom is to be in the midst of your enemies. And he who will not suffer this does not want to be of the Kingdom of Christ; he wants to be among friends, to sit among roses and lilies, not with the bad people but the devout people. O you blasphemers and betrayers of Christ! If Christ had done what you are doing who would ever have been spared' (Luther).

I wonder,â he said, âwhether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us may find his own again...

Yoga is not a religion. It is a science, science of well-being, science of youthfulness, science of integrating body, mind and soul.

Leaders must be close enough to relate to others, but far enough ahead to motivate them.

She liked being reminded of butterflies. She remembered being six or seven and crying over the fates of the butterflies in her yard after learning that they lived for only a few days. Her mother had comforted her and told her not to be sad for the butterflies, that just because their lives were short didn't mean they were tragic. Watching them flying in the warm sun among the daisies in their garden, her mother had said to her, see, they have a beautiful life. Alice liked remembering that.

Life is only precious because it ends, kid. Take it from a god. You mortals don't know how lucky you are

How would your life be different ifâ¦You approached all relationships with authenticity and honesty? Let today be the dayâ¦You dedicate yourself to building relationships on the solid foundation of truth and authenticity.

I am so, so alive.

You can only be afraid of what you think you know.

Life isn't about having, it's about being. You could surround yourself with all that money can buy, and you'd still be as miserable as a human can be. I know people with perfect bodies who don't have half the happiness I've found. On my journeys I've seen more joy in the slums of Mumbai and the orphanages of Africa than in wealthy gated communities and on sprawling estates worth millions. Why is that? You'll find contentment when your talents and passion are completely engaged, in full force. Recognise instant self-gratification for what it is. Resist the temptation to grab for material objects like the perfect house, the coolest clothes or the hottest car. The if I just had X, I would be happy syndrome is a mass delusion. When you look for happiness in mere objects, they are never enough. Look around. Look within.

It's easy to forget things you don't need anymore.

you don't have to worry about burning bridges, if you're building your own

If you believe you can, you might. If you know you can, you will.

If you surrendered to the air, you could ride it.

A Nation should not be judged by how it treats its highest citizens, but it's lowest ones

The most powerful relationship you will ever have is the relationship with yourself.

The mistake ninety-nine percent of humanity made, as far as Fats could see, was being ashamed of what they were; lying about it, trying to be somebody else.

The aim of every artist is to arrest motion, which is life, by artificial means and hold it fixed so that a hundred years later, when a stranger looks at it, it moves again since it is life.

Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a great ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair.
 I have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy - ecstasy so great that I would often have sacrificed all the rest of life for a few hours of this joy. I have sought it, next, because it relieves loneliness--that terrible loneliness in which one shivering consciousness looks over the rim of the world into the cold unfathomable lifeless abyss. I have sought it finally, because in the union of love I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined. This is what I sought, and though it might seem too good for human life, this is what--at last--I have found.
With equal passion I have sought knowledge. I have wished to understand the hearts of men. I have wished to know why the stars shine. And I have tried to apprehend the Pythagorean power by which number holds sway above the flux. A little of this, but not much, I have achieved.
 Love and knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward toward the heavens. But always pity brought me back to earth. Echoes of cries of pain reverberate in my heart. Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors, helpless old people a burden to their sons, and the whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain make a mockery of what human life should be. I long to alleviate this evil, but I cannot, and I too suffer.
 This has been my life. I have found it worth living, and would gladly live it again if the chance were offered me.

The best discoveries always happened to the people who weren't looking for it. Columbus and America. Pinzon, who stumbled on Brazil while looking for the West Indies. Stanley happening on Victoria Falls. And you. Amy Curry, when I was least expecting her.

Next to trying and winning, the best thing is trying and failing.

Skies are crying,
I am watching,
Catching teardrops in my hands.
Only silence, as it's ending,
Like we never had a chance.
Do you have to make me feel
Like there's nothing left of me?

Achievement has no color

One of the best ways to influence people is to make them feel important. Most people enjoy those rare moments when others make them feel important. It is one of the deepest human desires.

In essence, if we want to direct our lives, we must take control of our consistent actions. It's not what we do once in a while that shapes our lives, but what we do consistently.

Do nothing, and nothing happens. Life is about decisions. You either make them or they're made for you, but you can't avoid them.

Live all you can: it's a mistake not to. It doesn't matter what you do in particular, so long as you have had your life. If you haven't had that, what have you had?

Life is short. Focus on what really matters most; you should change your priorities over time.

Iâve gotta get out of the basement. Iâve gotta see the world. Iâve gotta make a difference

Maybe you think youâll be entitled to more happiness later by forgoing all of it now, but it doesnât work that way. Happiness takes as much practice as unhappiness does. Itâs by living that you live more. By waiting you wait more. Every waiting day makes your life a little less. Every lonely day makes you a little smaller. Every day you put off your life makes you less capable of living it.

There are two things we should always be 1. raw and 2. ready. When you are raw, you are always ready and when you are ready you usually realize that you are raw. Waiting for perfection is not an answer, one cannot say "I will be ready when I am perfect" because then you will never be ready, rather one must say "I am raw and I am ready just like this right now, how and who I am.

To write is human, to edit is divine.

The truth was a mirror in the hands of God. It fell, and broke into pieces. Everybody took a piece of it, and they looked at it and thought they had the truth.

Maybe some things aren't meant to be known. maybe there just meant to be accepted.

Women can fake an orgasm, but men can fake an entire relationship.

He who takes offense when no offense is intended is a fool, and he who takes offense when offense is intended is a greater fool.

Courage and perseverance have a magical talisman, before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish into air.

I'm the living embodiment of 'it could be worse'.

Politeness is okay, but it gets old and boring. You want to attack life with a passion, not a politeness, you want people to think about you and remember you and say "she is so passionate" you don't want people to think about you and remember you and say "she is so polite," because, who cares about polite?

Get comfortable with being uncomfortable!

If people reach perfection they vanish, you know.

Truth does not become more true by virtue of the fact that the entire world agrees with it, nor less so even if the whole world disagrees with it.

Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose.

I was never more hated than when I tried to be honest. Or when, even as just now I've tried to articulate exactly what I felt to be the truth. No one was satisfied

All the time you're saying to yourself, 'I could do that, but I won't,' â which is just another way of saying that you can't.

Try to find pleasure in the speed that you're not used to. Changing the way you do routine things allows a new person to grow inside of you. But when all is said and done, you're the one who must decide how you handle it.

Ignore all hatred and criticism. Live for what you create, and die protecting it.

Love is like a good cake; you never know when it's coming, but you'd better eat it when it does!

Go on, get out! Last words are for fools who haven't said enough!

The culture of women in the church today is crippled by some very pervasive lies. "To be spiritual is to be busy. To be spiritual is to be disciplined. To be spiritual is to be dutiful." No, to be spiritual is to be in Romance with God. The desire to be romanced lies deep in the heart of every women. It is for such that you were made. Are you ARE romanced, and ever will be.

Doing the best at this moment puts you in the best place for the mext moment

Sometimes you have to steer away from the crowd in order to be a better person. It's not always easy, that's for sure. But it's right. And sometimes doing the right thing feels good, even if it does end up in a trip to the principal's office.

Try to remember it always," he said once Gogol had reached him, leading him slowly back across the breakwater, to where his mother and Sonia stood waiting. "Remember that you and I made this journey together to a place where there was nowhere left to go.

For great men, religion is a way of making friends; small people make religion a fighting tool.

That which we persist in doing becomes easier to do, not that the nature of the thing has changed but that our power to do has increased.

Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.

Light a candle instead of cursing the darkness.

By declaring that man is responsible and must actualize the potential meaning of his life, I wish to stress that the true meaning of life is to be discovered in the world rather than within man or his own psyche, as though it were a closed system. I have termed this constitutive characteristic "the self-transcendence of human existence." It denotes the fact that being human always points, and is directed, to something or someone, other than oneself--be it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself--by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love--the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself. What is called self-actualization is not an attainable aim at all, for the simple reason that the more one would strive for it, the more he would miss it. In other words, self-actualization is possible only as a side-effect of self-transcendence.

Andaikata semua kehidupan ini menyakitkan, maka di luar sana pasti masih ada sepotong bagian yang menyenangkan. Kemudian kau akan membenak pasti ada sesuatu yang jauh lebih indah dari menatap rembulan di langit. Kau tidak tahu apa itu, karna ilmumu terbatas.

It is not enough to be industrious; so are the ants. What are you industrious about?

And so I wait. I wait for time to heal the pain and raise me to me feet once again - so that I can start a new path, my own path, the one that will make me whole again.

The hardest battle you are ever going to have to fight is the battle to be just you.

Give your weakness to one who helps.

Some people try to tell you the things you want in life are out of your grasp, while others lift you up on their shoulders and help you reach them. I may not know a lot, but I prefer to fill my life with people who let me climb on top of their shoulders, not people who try to keep me planted on the ground.

People who lack the clarity, courage, or determination to follow their own dreams will often find ways to discourage yours. Live your truth and don't EVER stop!

He asked, 'Croesus, who told you to attack my land and meet me as an enemy instead of a friend?'
The King replied, 'It was caused by your good fate and my bad fate. It was the fault of the Greek gods, who with their arrogance, encouraged me to march onto your lands. Nobody is mad enough to choose war whilst there is peace. During times of peace, the sons bury their fathers, but in war it is the fathers who send their sons to the grave.

When things go wrong, you'll find they usually go on getting worse for some time; but when things once start going right they often go on getting better and better.

I ask of you your lives,â Elend said, voice echoing, âand your courage. I ask of you your faith, and your honorâyour strength, and your compassion. For today, I lead you to die.

There was a brief pause.
âIn the end, they will kill us,â Elend said, voice loud, ringing in the cavern. âBut first, they shall

Who belonged to no one, who belonged to everyone.

Is it easy? Usually not. But you don't forgive people for their benefit. You do it for your benefit.

Look not mournfully into the past, it comes not back again. Wisely improve the present, it is thine. Go forth to meet the shadowy future without fear and with a manly heart.

Even if you don't have all the things you want, be grateful for the things you don't have that you don't want (Bob Dylan's dad)

Begin doing what you want to do now. We are not living in eternity. We have only this moment, sparkling like a star in our hand--and melting like a snowflake...

A complete stranger has the capacity to alter the life of another irrevocably. This domino effect has the capacity to change the course of an entire world. That is what life is; a chain reaction of individuals colliding with others and influencing their lives without realizing it. A decision that seems miniscule to you, may be monumental to the fate of the world.

To all that come to this happy place, welcome. Disneyland is your land. Here age relives fond memories of the past, and here youth may savor the challenge and promise of the future. Disneyland is dedicated to the ideals, the dreams, and the hard facts that have created America... with hope that it will be a source of joy and inspiration to all the world.

I realized it for the first time in my life: there is nothing but mystery in the world, how it hides behind the fabric of our poor, browbeat days, shining brightly, and we don't even know it.

Every window in Alcatraz has a view of San Francisco. 

You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word. It is victory, victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no survival.

An individual has not started living until he can rise above the narrow confines of his individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity.

It is much easier to be brave if you do not know everything.

If you don't love yourself, how in the hell you gonna love somebody else?

If you want to catch beasts you don't see every day,
You have to go places quite out of the way,
You have to go places no others can get to.
You have to get cold and you have too get wet, too.

When you chase a dream, you learn about yourself. You learn your capabilities and limitations, and the value of hard work and persistence.

Live boldly. Push yourself. Don't settle.

Sometimes I go to God and say, "God, if Thou dost never answer another prayer while I live on this earth, I will still worship Thee as long as I live and in the ages to come for what Thou hast done already. Godâs already put me so far in debt that if I were to live one million millenniums I couldnât pay Him for what Heâs done for me.

My hope still is to leave the world a bit better than when I got here.

You have to teach your heart and mind how to sing together... then you'll hear the sound of your soul

Before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons weâve learned as weâve moved toward that dream. Thatâs the point at which most people give up. Itâs the point at which, as we say in the language of the desert, one 'dies of thirst just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon.

if you don't have peace, it isn't because someone took it from you; you gave it away. You cannot always control what happens to you, but you can control what happens in you.

Hanya orang-orang dengan hati damailah yang boleh menerima kejadian buruk dengan lega.

You don't know, oh, oh
You don't know you're beautiful.

Not everything is supposed to become something beautiful and long-lasting. Sometimes people come into your life to show you what is right and what is wrong, to show you who you can be, to teach you to love yourself, to make you feel better for a little while, or to just be someone to walk with at night and spill your life to. Not everyone is going to stay forever, and we still have to keep on going and thank them for what theyâve given us.

When we are most alone is when we embrace another's loneliness.

Each of us is full of shit in our own special way. We are all shitty little snowflakes dancing in the universe.

Stand up and walk. Move on. After all, you have perfect legs to stand on.

Life keeps throwing me lemons because I make the best lemonade...

I know that the molecules in my body are traceable to phenomena in the cosmos. That makes me want to grab people on the street and say: âHave you HEARD THIS?

And by and by Christopher Robin came to the end of things, and he was silent, and he sat there, looking out over the world, just wishing it wouldn't stop.

Itâs against the rules of humanity to believe there is nothing we can do.

The nights you fight best are
when all the weapons are pointed at you,
when all the voices hurl their insults
while the dream is being strangled.
The nights you fight best are
when reason gets kicked in the gut,
when the chariots of gloom encircle you.
The nights you fight best are
when the laughter of fools fills the air,
when the kiss of death is mistaken for love.
The nights you fight best are
when the game is fixed,
when the crowd screams for your blood.
The nights you fight best are
on a night like this
as you chase a thousand dark rats from your brain,
as you rise up against the impossible,
as you become a brother to the tender sister of joy
and move on 
regardless.

Life is at its best when everything has fallen out of place, and you decide that you're going to fight to get them right, not when everything is going your way and everyone is praising you.

I want a tattoo over my heart that reads TRY HARDER YOU LAZY PARAMEDIC SHITBAG OR I WILL HAUNT YOUR BEDROOM FOREVER


 But the country's disintegrating. What's happened to America? What's happened to the American dream?
 It came true. You're lookin' at it.

Thou shalt not be a victim, thou shalt not be a perpetrator, but, above all, thou shalt not be a bystander.

Sometimes to self-discover you must self-destruct.

If you fuel your journey on the opinions of others, you are going to run out of gas.

Create your own miracles; do what you think you cannot do.

There is no failure except in no longer trying.

Argue for your limitations and, sure enough, they're yours.

A man, though wise, should never be ashamed of learning more, and must unbend his mind.

All paths are present, always... and we can but choose among them.

Only two things can reveal life's great secrets: suffering and love.

Don't forget, a person's greatest emotional need is to feel appreciated.

There are several ways to react to being lost. One is to panic: this was usually Valentina's first impulse. Another is to abandon yourself to lostness, to allow the fact that you've misplaced yourself to change the way you experience the world.

People trust their eyes above all else - but most people see what they wish to see, or what they believe they should see; not what is really there

Love your life. Because your life is what you have to give.

Successful people don't have fewer problems. They have determined that nothing will stop them from going forward.

Everything you'll ever need to know is within you; the secrets of the universe are imprinted on the cells of your body.

Let us try to teach generosity and altruism, because we are born selfish. Let us understand what our own selfish genes are up to, because we may then at least have the chance to upset their designs, something that no other species has ever aspired to do.

It is harder to crack prejudice than an atom.

In his suicide note, Kurt Cobain wrote, "It's better to burn out than to fade away." He was quoting a Neil Young song about Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols. When I was twenty-four, I interviewed John Lennon. I asked him about this sentiment, one that pervades rock and roll. He took strong, outraged exception to it. "It's better to fade away like an old soldier than to burn out, " he said. "I worship people who survive. I'll take the living and the healthy.

Miracles do not, in fact, break the laws of nature.

Truly powerful people have great humility. They do not try to impress, they do not try to be influential. They simply are. People are magnetically drawn to them. They are most often very silent and focused, aware of their core selves. ... They never persuade, nor do they use manipulation or aggressiveness to get their way. They listen. If there is anything they can offer to assist you, they offer it; if not, they are silent.

Fear tends to come from ignorance. Once I knew what the problem was, it was just a problem, nothing to fear.

Life is very short, and there's no time for fussing and fighting my friends

Love doesnât have to be on Valentineâs Day. It doesnât have to be by the time you turn eighteen or thirty-three or fifty-nine. It doesnât have to conform to whatever is usual. It doesnât have to be kismet at once, or rhapsody by the third day.
It just has to be. In time. In place. In spirt.
It just has to be.

Sometimes letting go is simply changing the labels you place on an event. Looking at the same event with fresh eyes.

Muscles aching to work, minds aching to create - this is man.

In the external scheme of things, shining moments are as brief as the twinkling of an eye, yet such twinklings are what eternity is made of -- moments when we human beings can say "I love you," "I'm proud of you," "I forgive you," "I'm grateful for you." That's what eternity is made of: invisible imperishable good stuff.

Sometimes the most beautiful people are beautifully broken.

Sometimes a little discomfort in the beginning can save a whole lot of pain down the road.

Too many of us are not living our dreams because we are living our fears.

Until justice rolls down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream.

The treacherous are ever distrustful.

Keep your mind open. The meaning of things lies in how people perceive them. The same thing could mean different meanings to the same people at different times.

A lot of people have gone further than they thought they could because someone else thought they could

she was glad she had been scarred. She said that whoever loved her now would love her true self, and not her pretty face.

that as long as we are being remembered, we remain alive.

Everything happens for a reason and, something better will come along for me!

A winner is a dreamer who never gives up

To invent your own life's meaning is not easy, but it's still allowed, and I think you'll be happier for the trouble.

Tearing down the rest of the world won't make you happy. Look inside yourself. Because finding who you were meant to be? What you were put into this world to do? That's what fills the emptiness. It's the only things that can.

Do more than belong: participate. Do more than care: help. Do more than believe: practice. Do more than be fair: be kind. Do more than forgive: forget. Do more than dream: work.

Talent is a gift, but character is a choice.

LAW 38
Think As You Like But Behave Like Others
If you make a show of going against the times, flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox ways, people will think that you only want attention and that you look down upon them. They will find a way to punish you for making them feel inferior. It is far safer to blend in and nurture the common touch. Share your originality only with tolerant friends and those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness.

I am a strong believer in the tyranny, the dictatorship, the absolute authority of the writer.

Gratitude is a sign of maturity...Where there is appreciation: there is also courtesy and concern for the rights and property of others.

If it can be destroyed by the truth, it deserves to be destroyed by the truth.

No man is brave that has never walked a hundred miles. If you want to know the truth of who you are, walk until not a person knows your name. Travel is the great leveler, the great teacher, bitter as medicine, crueler than mirror-glass. A long stretch of road will teach you more about yourself than a hundred years of quiet.

The future was one thing that could never be broken, because it had not yet had the chance to be anything.

Most lives are not distinguished by great achievements. They are measured by an infinite number of small ones. Each time you do a kindness for someone or bring a smile to his face, it gives your life meaning. Never doubt your value, little friend. The world would be a dismal place without you in it. (tweaked version of a passage from Scandal in Spring)

When you are used to the kind of life -of never getting anything you want- you stop knowing what it is you want.

Ends are for yesterday, not tomorrows.

There is no such thing as a child who hates to read; there are only children who have not found the right book.

Cinta hanyalah segumpal perasaan dalam hati. Sama halnya dengan gumpal perasaan senang, gembira, sedih, sama dengan kau suka makan gilau kepala ikan, suka mesin. Bedanya, kita selama ini terbiasa mengistimewakan gumpal perasaan yang disebut cinta. Kita beri dia porsi lebih penting, kita bersarkan, terus menggumpal membesar. Coba saja kau cuekin, kau lupakan, maka gumpal cinta itu juga dengan cepat layu seperti kau bosan makan gulai kepala ikan.

Quietly endure, silently suffer and patiently wait.

That is the hardest thing of all. It is much harder to judge yourself than to judge others. If you succeed in judging yourself, it's because you're truly a wise man.

I close my eyes 
 and I can see a better day. 
 I close my eyes 
 and pray

I never did give them hell. I just told the truth, and they thought it was hell.

be it peace or happiness
let it enfold you

I wrote the song 'Down to Earth' a few years ago, and i was really excited to record it for My World album. It's a huge fan favourite. So many people feel where i'm coming from. It doesn't need any spectacular stage effects in the touring show; the best thing i can do is just sing it straight from my heart. I'm not afraid to show my emotions; if you love someone, you should tell them. If you think a girl is beautiful, you should say that. Usher says some songs work best when there's a sob in the singer's voice. You gotta let that deep feeling come through. And that's how i felt about this song. Sometimes the emotion of it is enough to bring tears to my eyes.

Somewhere along the way we all go a bit mad. So burn, let go and dive into the horror, because maybe itâs the chaos which helps us find where we belong.

I only hope that we never lose sight of one thing â that it was all started by a mouse.

Sometimes small things can become very large, indeed.

As the smoke clears,
I awaken,
And untangle you from me.
Would it make you feel better
To watch me, while I bleed?
All my windows still are broken,
But I'm standing on my feet.

But why think about that when all the golden lands ahead of you and all kinds of unforseen events wait lurking to surprise you and make you glad you're alive to see?

I want you to know
one thing. 
You know how this is: 
if I look 
at the crystal moon, at the red branch 
of the slow autumn at my window, 
if I touch 
near the fire 
the impalpable ash 
or the wrinkled body of the log, 
everything carries me to you, 
as if everything that exists, 
aromas, light, metals, 
were little boats 
that sail 
toward those isles of yours that wait for me. 
Well, now, 
if little by little you stop loving me 
I shall stop loving you little by little. 
If suddenly 
you forget me 
do not look for me, 
for I shall already have forgotten you. 
If you think it long and mad, 
the wind of banners 
that passes through my life, 
and you decide 
to leave me at the shore 
of the heart where I have roots, 
remember 
that on that day, 
at that hour, 
I shall lift my arms 
and my roots will set off 
to seek another land. 
But 
if each day, 
each hour, 
you feel that you are destined for me 
with implacable sweetness, 
if each day a flower 
climbs up to your lips to seek me, 
ah my love, ah my own, 
in me all that fire is repeated, 
in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten, 
my love feeds on your love, beloved, 
and as long as you live it will be in your arms 
without leaving mine.

There, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tor high up in the mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him. For like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach.

Our opportunities to give of ourselves are indeed limitless, but they are also perishable. There are hearts to gladden. There are kind words to say. There are gifts to be given. There are deeds to be done. There are souls to be saved.
As we remember that âwhen ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God,â (Mosiah 2:17) we will not find ourselves in the unenviable position of Jacob Marleyâs ghost, who spoke to Ebenezer Scrooge in Charles Dickensâs immortal "Christmas Carol." Marley spoke sadly of opportunities lost. Said he: 'Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness. Not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one lifeâs opportunity misused! Yet such was I! Oh! such was I!'
Marley added: 'Why did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down, and never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a poor abode? Were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me!'
Fortunately, as we know, Ebenezer Scrooge changed his life for the better. I love his line, 'I am not the man I was.'
Why is Dickensâ "Christmas Carol" so popular? Why is it ever new? I personally feel it is inspired of God. It brings out the best within human nature. It gives hope. It motivates change. We can turn from the paths which would lead us down and, with a song in our hearts, follow a star and walk toward the light. We can quicken our step, bolster our courage, and bask in the sunlight of truth. We can hear more clearly the laughter of little children. We can dry the tear of the weeping. We can comfort the dying by sharing the promise of eternal life. If we lift one weary hand which hangs down, if we bring peace to one struggling soul, if we give as did the Master, we canâby showing the wayâbecome a guiding star for some lost mariner.

Happiness is a choice that requires effort at times.

In order to write the book you want to write, in the end you have to become the person you need to become to write that book.

You think of yourself
as a citizen of the universe.
You think you belong 
to this world of dust and matter.
Out of this dust
you have created a personal image,
and have forgotten
about the essence of your true origin

...mencintai itu, kadang mengumpulkan segala tabiat menyebalkan dari seseorang yang engkau cintai, memakinya, merasa tak sanggup lagi menjadi yang terbaik untuk dirinya, dan berpikir tak ada lagi jalan kembali, tapi tetap saja engkau tak sanggup benar-benar meninggalkannya.

What the mind can conceive and believe, and the heart desire, you can achieve.

Maybe we shouldn't be looking for love. Maybe we should be looking for a person. Because maybe you can find love in a person, but not have that person. So if you look for love, what you will find is love. But if you want to belong to someone, and you want someone to belong to you, you should look for a person.

Heaven is comfort, but it's still not living.

War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things: the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth a war, is much worse. When a people are used as mere human instruments for firing cannon or thrusting bayonets, in the service and for the selfish purposes of a master, such war degrades a people. A war to protect other human beings against tyrannical injustice; a war to give victory to their own ideas of right and good, and which is their own war, carried on for an honest purpose by their free choice, â is often the means of their regeneration. A man who has nothing which he is willing to fight for, nothing which he cares more about than he does about his personal safety, is a miserable creature who has no chance of being free, unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself. As long as justice and injustice have not terminated their ever-renewing fight for ascendancy in the affairs of mankind, human beings must be willing, when need is, to do battle for the one against the other.

We are what we believe we are!

Having an eye for beauty isn't the same thing as a weakness...except possibly when it comes to you.

A tamed woman will never leave her mark in the world.

One more dance along the razor's edge finished. Almost dead yesterday, maybe dead tomorrow, but alive, gloriously alive, today.

Meditation is a way for nourishing and blossoming the divinity within you.

You lose nothing when fighting for a cause ... In my mind the losers are those who don't have a cause they care about.

Freedom is...the right to write the wrong words.

Life consists of two days, one for you one against you. So when it's for you don't be proud or reckless, and when it's against you be patient, for both days are test for you.

The world is wide, and I will not waste my life in friction when it could be turned into momentum. 

Youâre only poor if you give up. The most important thing is that you did something. Most people only talk and dream of getting rich. Youâve done something.

In life, people tend to wait for good things to come to them. And by waiting, they miss out. Usually, what you wish for doesn't fall in your lap; it falls somewhere nearby, and you have to recognize it, stand up, and put in the time and work it takes to get to it. This isn't because the universe is cruel. It's because the universe is smart. It has its own cat-string theory and knows we don't appreciate things that fall into our laps.

We have been called to heal wounds, to unite what has fallen apart, and to bring home those who have lost their way.

But what is life if you don't live it?

Do not waste the precious moments of this, your present reality, seeking to unveil all of life's secrets. Those secrets are a secret for a reason. Grant your God the benefit of the doubt. Use your NOW moment for the Highest Purpose- the creation and the expression of WHO YOU REALLY ARE. Decide who you are- who you want to be-and then do everything in your power to be that.
It is not nearly so important how well a message is received as how well it is sent. You cannot take responsibility for how well another accepts your truth; you can only ensure how well it is communicated. And by how well, I don't mean merely how clearly; I mean how lovingly, how compassionately, how sensitively, how courageously, and how completely.
If you think your life is about DOINGNESS, you do not understand what you are about. Your soul doesn't care what you do for a living-and when your life is over, neither will you. Your soul cares only about what you're BEING while you're doing whatever you're doing. It is a state of BEINGNESS the soul is after, not a state of doingness.

Life did not stop, and one had to live.

You can't do anything about the length of your life, but you can do something about its width and depth.

Believe me, It would be better if we didn't meet again. Go back to school. Go back to your life. And next time they ask you, say no. Killing is for grown-ups and you're still a child.

Never give up on what you really want to do. The person with big dreams is more powerful than one with all the facts.

Life is a funny thing. We only get so many years to live it, so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be. We shouldn't waste time on things that might happen someday, or maybe even never.

We are the cosmos made conscious and life is the means by which the universe understands itself.

Great men are like eagles, and build their nest on some lofty solitude

Maybe your country is only a place you make up in your own mind. Something you dream about and sing about. Maybe it's not a place on the map at all, but just a story full of people you meet and places you visit, full of books and films you've been to. I'm not afraid of being homesick and having no language to live in. I don't have to be like anyone else. I'm walking on the wall and nobody can stop me.

Forgive yourself before you die. Then forgive others.

I gave myself permission to care, because there are a lot of people in this world who are afraid of caring, who are afraid of showing they care because itâs uncool. Itâs uncool to have passion. Itâs so much easier to lose when youâve shown everyone how much you donât care if you win or lose. Itâs much harder to lose when you show that you care, but youâll never win unless you also stand to lose. Iâve said it before. Donât be afraid of your passion, give it free reign, and be honest and work hard and it will all turn out just fine.

Itâs not over if youâre still here,â Chronicler said. âItâs not a tragedy if youâre still alive.

Perfect is the enemy of good.

Life is going to give you just what you put in it. Put your whole heart in everything you do, and pray, then you can wait.

Don't chase people. Be yourself, do your own thing and work hard. The right people - the ones who really belong in your life - will come to your. And stay.

God uses broken things. It takes broken soil to produce a crop, broken clouds to give rain, broken grain to give bread, broken bread to give strength. It is the broken alabaster box that gives forth perfume. It is Peter, weeping bitterly, who returns to greater power than ever.

Work is love made visible. And if you can't work with love, but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of the people who work with joy

Spend the afternoon, you can't take it with you.

You are a cosmic flower. Om chanting is the process of opening the psychic petals of that flower.

I believe that God is in me as the sun is in the colour and fragrance of a flower - the Light in my darkness, the Voice in my silence.

God has given us more than fourteen billion cells and connections in our brain. Why would God give us such a complex organ system unless he expects us to use it?

Can't stand all these poisonous creatures, all these snakes and insects and fish and things. Wretched things, biting everybody. And then people expect me to tell them what to do about it. I'll tell them what to do. Don't get bitten in the first place. (quoting Dr. Struan Sutherland)

Stand firm in the Lord. Stand firm and let Him fight your battle. Do not try to fight alone.

Avoid loud and aggressive persons,

Of life's two chief prizes, beauty and truth, I found the first in a loving heart and the second in a laborer's hand.

Bring something incomprehensible into the world!

We rich nations, for that is what we are, have an obligation not only to the poor nations, but to all the grandchildren of the world, rich and poor.

How are you coming with your home library? Do you need some good ammunition on why it's so important to read? The last time I checked the statistics...I think they indicated that only four percent of the adults in this country have bought a book within the past year. That's dangerous. It's extremely important that we keep ourselves in the top five or six percent. 	
In one of the Monthly Letters from the Royal Bank of Canada it was pointed out that reading good books is not something to be indulged in as a luxury. It is a necessity for anyone who intends to give his life and work a touch of quality. The most real wealth is not what we put into our piggy banks but what we develop in our heads. Books instruct us without anger, threats and harsh discipline. They do not sneer at our ignorance or grumble at our mistakes. They ask only that we spend some time in the company of greatness so that we may absorb some of its attributes.
You do not read a book for the book's sake, but for your own.
You may read because in your high-pressure life, studded with problems and emergencies, you need periods of relief and yet recognize that peace of mind does not mean numbness of mind.
You may read because you never had an opportunity to go to college, and books give you a chance to get something you missed. You may read because your job is routine, and books give you a feeling of depth in life.
You may read because you did go to college.
You may read because you see social, economic and philosophical problems which need solution, and you believe that the best thinking of all past ages may be useful in your age, too.
You may read because you are tired of the shallowness of contemporary life, bored by the current conversational commonplaces, and wearied of shop talk and gossip about people.
Whatever your dominant personal reason, you will find that reading gives knowledge, creative power, satisfaction and relaxation. It cultivates your mind by calling its faculties into exercise.
Books are a source of pleasure - the purest and the most lasting. They enhance your sensation of the interestingness of life. Reading them is not a violent pleasure like the gross enjoyment of an uncultivated mind, but a subtle delight.
Reading dispels prejudices which hem our minds within narrow spaces. One of the things that will surprise you as you read good books from all over the world and from all times of man is that human nature is much the same today as it has been ever since writing began to tell us about it.
Some people act as if it were demeaning to their manhood to wish to be well-read but you can no more be a healthy person mentally without reading substantial books than you can be a vigorous person physically without eating solid food. Books should be chosen, not for their freedom from evil, but for their possession of good. Dr. Johnson said: "Whilst you stand deliberating which book your son shall read first, another boy has read both.

If the only prayer you say throughout your life is "Thank You," then that will be enough.

When they say the sky's the limit to me that's really true

They say that every snowflake is different. If that were true, how could the world go on? How could we ever get up off our knees? How could we ever recover from the wonder of it?

The greatest pleasure in life is doing what people say you cannot do.

Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle.

I am Me. In all the world, there is no one else exactly like me. Everything that comes out of me is authentically mine, because I alone chose it -- I own everything about me: my body, my feelings, my mouth, my voice, all my actions, whether they be to others or myself. I own my fantasies, my dreams, my hopes, my fears. I own my triumphs and successes, all my failures and mistakes. Because I own all of me, I can become intimately acquainted with me. By so doing, I can love me and be friendly with all my parts. I know there are aspects about myself that puzzle me, and other aspects that I do not know -- but as long as I am friendly and loving to myself, I can courageously and hopefully look for solutions to the puzzles and ways to find out more about me. However I look and sound, whatever I say and do, and whatever I think and feel at a given moment in time is authentically me. If later some parts of how I looked, sounded, thought, and felt turn out to be unfitting, I can discard that which is unfitting, keep the rest, and invent something new for that which I discarded. I can see, hear, feel, think, say, and do. I have the tools to survive, to be close to others, to be productive, and to make sense and order out of the world of people and things outside of me. I own me, and therefore, I can engineer me. I am me, and I am Okay.

It's very dramatic when two people come together to work something out. It's easy to take a gun and annihilate your opposition, but what is really exciting to me is to see people with differing views come together and finally respect each other.

A photographer is like a cod, which produces a million eggs in order that one may reach maturity.

know what you want, work to get it, then value it once you have it.

Every person has a right to risk their own life for the preservation of it.

A young outcast will often feel that there is something wrong with himself, but as he gets older, grows more confident in who he is, he will adapt, he will begin to feel that there is something wrong with everyone else.

Life might take you down different roads. But each of you gets to decide which one to take.

Is there any real purpose in being alive if all we are going to do is get up every day and live only for ourselves?
Live your life to help others. Give & live selflessly.

Your own Self-Realization is the greatest service you can render the world.

Peace is present right here and now, in ourselves and in everything we do and see. Every breath we take, every step we take, can be filled with peace, joy, and serenity. The question is whether or not we are in touch with it. We need only to be awake, alive in the present moment.

Count your blessings. Once you realize how valuable you are and how much you have going for you, the smiles will return, the sun will break out, the music will play, and you will finally be able to move forward the life that God intended for you with grace, strength, courage, and confidence.

Do not yearn to be popular; be exquisite. Do not desire to be famous; be loved. Do not take pride in being expected; be palpable, unmistakable.

Death twitches my ear;
'Live,' he says... 
'I'm coming.

If you are still breathing maybe it is not such a bad day after all...

I am not afraid... I was born to do this.

My experiences have taught me that things rarely improve with a simple change of scenery.

You are beautiful. Know this. Anyone who tells you otherwise is simply lying. You are beautiful.

You are doing the best you can, and that best results in good to yourself and to others. Do not nag yourself with a sense of failure. Get on your knees and ask for the blessings of the Lord;then stand on your feet and do what you are asked to do.

We all can be only who we are, no more, no less.

There is a road from the eye to the heart that does not go through the intellect.

Whatever you see you gotta keep a sense of humor; you gotta be able to smile through all the bullshit.

If you are not the hero of your own story, then you're missing the whole point of your humanity.

To have regret is to be disappointed with yourself and your choices. Those who are wise, see their life like stepping stones across a great river. Everyone misses a stone from time to time. No one can cross the river without getting wet. Success is measured by your arrival on the other side, not on how muddy your shoes are. Regrets are only felt by those who do not understand lifeâs purpose. They become so disillusioned that they stand still in the river and do not take the next leap.

Don't ever give up. 
Don't ever give in. 
Don't ever stop trying. 
Don't ever sell out. 
And if you find yourself succumbing to one of the above for a brief moment, 
pick yourself up, brush yourself off, whisper a prayer, and start where you left off.
But never, ever, ever give up.

I know in my heart that man is good, that what is right will always eventually triumph, and there is purpose and worth to each and every life.

... itâs a blessed thing to love and feel loved in return.

We join spokes together in a wheel, 
but it is the center hole 
that makes the wagon move.
We shape clay into a pot, 
but it is the emptiness inside
that holds whatever we want.
We hammer wood for a house, 
but it is the inner space
that makes it livable.
We work with being, 
but non-being is what we use.

What the soul hardly realizes is that, unbeliever or not, his loneliness is really a homesickness for God.

Be not afraid of life. Believe that life is worth living, and your belief will help create the fact.

But what if Shakespeareâ and Hamletâ were asking the wrong question? What if the real question is not whether 
 be, but 
 to be?

To be kind, honest and have positive thoughts; to forgive those who harm us and treat everyone as a friend; to help those who are suffering and never to consider ourselves superior to anyone else: even if this advice seems rather simplistic, make the effort of seeing whether by following it you can find greater happiness.

You are never alone. You are eternally connected with everyone.

I'd heard of Evergreen Care Center before. Cass and I had always made fun of the stupid ads they ran on TV, featuring some dragged-out woman with a limp perm and big, painted-on circles under her eyes, downing vodka and sobbing uncontrollably. "We can't heal you at Evergreen", the very somber voiceover said. "But we can help you to heal yourself." It had become our own running joke, applicable to almost anything.
 "Hey Cass, "I'd say, "hand me that toothpaste."
 "Caitlin," she'd say, her voice dark and serious. "I can't hand you the toothpaste. But I CAN help you hand the toothpaste to yourself.

Nobody can go back and start a new beginning, but anyone can start today and make a new ending.

Happiness comes when your work and words are of benefit to others.

The road to enlightenment is long and difficult, and you should try not to forget snacks and magazines.

A lot of the conflict you have in your life exists simply because you're not living in alignment; you're not be being true to yourself.

Life is like a play: it's not the length, but the excellence of the acting that matters.

Anything that makes weak - physically, intellectually and spiritually, reject it as poison.

There is only one day left, always starting over: It is given to us at dawn and taken away from us at dusk.

No matter what your history has been, your destiny is what you create today. What are you going to create?

What the society thinks is of no interest to me. All that's important is how I see myself. I know who who I am. I know the value of my work.

Small is the number of them that see with their own eyes and feel with their own hearts.

Dead yesterdays and unborn tomorrows, why fret about it, if today be sweet.

How would your life be different ifâ¦You stopped validating your victim mentality? Let today be the dayâ¦You shake off your self-defeating drama and embrace your innate ability to recover and achieve.

Grace is what picks me up and lifts my wings high above and I fly! Grace always conquers! Be graceful in everything; in anger, in sadness, in joy, in kindness, in unkindness, retain grace with you!

Read. Read anything. Read the things they say are good for you, and the things they claim are junk. You'll find what you need to find. Just read.

They alone live, who live for others.

90% of the game is half mental.

God helps those who strut their stuff.

Congratulations!
Today is your day.
You're off to Great Places!
You're off and away!

I give myself a good cry if I need it. But then I concentrate on the good things still in my life. I don't allow myself any more self-pity than that. A little each every morning, a few tears, and that's all.

The purpose of life is not to be happyâbut to matter, to be productive, to be useful, to have it make some difference that you lived at all.

Despite my ghoulish reputation, I really have the heart of a small boy. I keep it in a jar on my desk.

There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root.

Although I am a typical loner in my daily life, my awareness of belonging to the invisible community of those who strive for truth, beauty, and justice has prevented me from feelings of isolation.

My dear Watson," said [Sherlock Holmes], "I cannot agree with those who rank modesty among the virtues. To the logician all things should be seen exactly as they are, and to underestimate one's self is as much a departure from truth as to exaggerate one's own powers.

Undisturbed calmness of mind is attained by cultivating friendliness toward the happy, compassion for the unhappy, delight in the virtuous, and indifference toward the wicked.

you don't have to be great to get started, but you have to get started to be great.

I am not worried, Harry," said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. "I am with you.

For, after all, every one who wishes to gain true knowledge must climb the Hill Difficulty alone, and since there is no royal road to the summit, I must zigzag it in my own way. I slip back many times, I fall, I stand still, I run against the edge of hidden obstacles, I lose my temper and find it again and keep it better, I trudge on, I gain a little, I feel encouraged, I get more eager and climb higher and begin to see the widening horizon. Every struggle is a victory. One more effort and I reach the luminous cloud, the blue depths of the sky, the uplands of my desire.

Hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard.

Hindi ako naniniwalang kailangan ng tao mangarap dahil gusto nâya ng pera, o gusto nâyang sumikat, o gusto nâya ng impluwensya. Side effects na lang ang mga âto, sa tingin ko. Nangangarap ang tao dahil binigyan sâya ng Diyos ng kakayanang mangarap at tumupad nito. Tungkulin nâyang pagbutihin ang pagkatao nâya at mag-ambag ng tulong sa mundo. At wala na sâyang iba pang magagawang mas malaking kasalanan sa sarili bukod sa talikuran ang tungkuling yonâ¦ 

It is the useless things that make life worth living and that make life dangerous too: wine, love, art, beauty. Without them life is safe, but not worth bothering with.

Everyone is lonely, we have to remember that life is to be lived one day at a time. You cannot worry about the past or future. Happiness is in the now.

Boredom can be a lethal thing on a small island.

There is force in the universe, which, if we permit it, will flow through us and produce miraculous results.

Friends can make you feel that the world is smaller and less sneaky than it really is, because you know people who have similar experiences.

Pet names are a persistant remnant of childhood, a reminder that life is not always so serious, so formal, so complicated. They are a reminder, too, that one is not all things to all people.

The shell must break before the bird can fly.

Live authentically. Why would you continue to compromise something that's beautiful to create something that is fake?

Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.

In the deepest hour of the night, confess to yourself that you would die if you were forbidden to write. And look deep into your heart where it spreads its roots, the answer, and ask yourself, must I write?

A quitter never wins-and-a winner never quits.

Make every effort to change things you do not like. If you cannot make a change, change the way you have been thinking. You might find a new solution.

When you are living the best version of yourself, you inspire others to live the best versions of themselves.

It had never occurred to me that our lives, which had been so closely interwoven, could unravel with such speed.

Today is the oldest you've ever been, and the youngest you'll ever be again.

You don't always have to kiss a lot of frogs to recognize a prince when you find one 
-Henrietta Barett

If you care about someone enough, youâll always be there for them no matter what.

I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself

These people fail to realize that it is on the inside that God must be defended, not on the outside. They should direct their anger at themselves. For evil in the open is but evil from within that has been let out. The main battlefield for good is not the open ground of the public arena but the small clearing of each heart.

Life is ours to be spent, not to
be saved.

If we don't change the direction we are headed, we will end up where we are going.

Your world is a living expression of how you are using and have used your mind.

Many people pray to be kept out of unexpected problems. 
Some people pray to be able to confront and overcome them.

If someone does not want me it is not the end of the world. But if I do not want me, the world is nothing but endings.

I am fallen, flawed and imperfect. Yet drenched in the grace and mercy that is found in Jesus Christ, there is strength

Libraries store the energy that fuels the imagination. They open up windows to the world and inspire us to explore and achieve, and contribute to improving our quality of life. Libraries change lives for the better.

Those who travel to mountain-tops are half in love with themselves, and half in love with oblivion.

We have to pray with our eyes on God, not on the difficulties.

Most people die with their music still locked up inside them.

Integrity is doing what is right and truthful, and doing as you say you would do.

Books. They are lined up on shelves or stacked on a table. There they are wrapped up in their jackets, lines of neat print on nicely bound pages. They look like such orderly, static things. Then you, the reader come along. You open the book jacket, and it can be like opening the gates to an unknown city, or opening the lid of a treasure chest. You read the first word and you're off on a journey of exploration and discovery.

A child may not know how to feed itself, or what to eat, yet it knows hunger.

Not only is there often a right and wrong, but what goes around does come around, Karma exists, chickens do come home to roost, and as my mother, Phyllis, liked to say, âThere is always a day of reckoning.â The good among the great understand that every choice we make adds to the strength or weakness of our spiritsâourselves, or to use an old fashioned word for the same idea, our souls. That is every humanâs life work: to construct an identity bit by bit, to walk a path step by step, to live a life that is worthy of something higher, lighter, more fulfilling, and maybe even everlasting.

The one place where a man ought to get a square deal is in a courtroom, be he any color of the rainbow, but people have a way of carrying their resentments right into a jury box. As you grow older, you'll see white men cheat black men every day of your life, but let me tell you something and don't you forget it - whenever a white man does that to a black man, no matter who he is, how rich he is, or how fine a family he comes from, that white man is trash.

May my heart be kind, my mind fierce, and my spirit brave.

Death comes to us all; we can only choose how to face it when it comes.

Itâs funny. I met a man once who did a lot of mountain climbing. I asked him which was harder, ascending or descending? He said without a doubt descending, because ascending you were so focused on reaching the top, you avoided mistakes.
The backside of a mountain is a fight against human nature,â he said. âYou have to care as much about yourself on the way down as you did on the way up.

Scars show us where we have been, they do not dictate where we are going.

Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourslef or to gossip about others. Use your power of your word in the direction of truth and love.

Act as if! Act as if you're a wealthy man, rich already, and then you'll surely become rich. Act as if you have unmatched confidence and then people will surely have confidence in you. Act as if you have unmatched experience and then people will follow your advice. And act as if you are already a tremendous success, and as sure as I stand here today - you will become successful.

For the world is in a bad state, but everything will become still worse unless each of us does his best.

Don't turn over the rocks if you don't want to see the pale creatures who live under them.

The best kind of humans are the ones who stay.

The library smells like old books â a thousand leather doorways into other worlds. I hear silence, like the mind of God. I feel a presence in the empty chair beside me. The librarian watches me suspiciously. But the library is a sacred place, and I sit with the patron saint of readers. Pulsing goddess light moves through me for one moment like a glimpse of eternity instantly forgotten. She is gone. I smell mold, I hear the clock ticking, I see an empty chair. Ask me now and I'll say this is just a place where you can't play music or eat. She's gone. The library sucks.

Never give a sword to a man who can't dance.

The question is very understandable, but no one has found a satisfactory answer to it so far. Yes, why do they make still more gigantic planes, still heavier bombs and, at the same time, prefabricated houses for reconstruction? Why should millions be spent daily on the war and yet there's not a penny available for medical services, artists, or for poor people?
Why do some people have to starve, while there are surpluses rotting in other parts of the world? Oh, why are people so crazy?

The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. The fears are paper tigers. You can do anything you decide to do. You can act to change and control your life; and the procedure, the process is its own reward.

Kung matatakot kang harapin ang totoo at sabihin ang talagang nararamdaman mo dahil baka masaktan ka, isa lang ibig sabihin noon: ipinagkait mo na sa sarili mo ang pagiging masaya at kinarir mo ang magpakatanga.

By hook or by crook, I hope that you will possess yourselves of money enough to travel and to idle, to contemplate the future or the past of the world, to dream over books and loiter at street corners and let the line of thought dip deep into the stream

Arrange whatever pieces come your way.

Have you ever felt the longing for someone you could admire? For something, not to look down at, but up to?

Your inner strength is your outer foundation

You are old beyond your years Zoeybird. Believe in yourself and you will find a way. But remember darkness does not always equate to evil just like light does not always bring good.

Each day is God's gift to you. What you do with it is your gift to Him.

Aslan: You doubt your value. Don't run from who you are.

Most don't deserve your tears... and the ones that do will never make you cry.

Let's start a new tomorrow, today.

And I think that's what our world is desperately in need of - lovers, people who are building deep, genuine relationships with fellow strugglers along the way, and who actually know the faces of the people behind the issues they are concerned about.

If I am truly to become an autonomous woman, then I must take over that role of being my own guardian...I not only have to become my own husband, but I need to be my own father, too.

We crave for new sensations but soon become indifferent to them. The wonders of yesterday are today common occurrences

What Iâve realized is that life doesnât count for much unless youâre willing to do your small part to leave our children â all of our children â a better world. Any fool can have a child. That doesnât make you a father. Itâs the courage to raise a child that makes you a father.

Some people insist that 'mediocre' is better than 'best.' They delight in clipping wings because they themselves can't fly. They despise brains because they have none.

We humans do not understand compassion. In each moment of our lives, we betray it. Aye, we know of its worth, yet in knowing we then attach to it a value, we guard the giving of it, believing it must be earned, Tâlan Imass. Compassion is priceless in the truest sense of the wold. It must be given freely. In abundance.

If you hear how wonderful you are often enough, you begin to believe it, no matter how you try to resist it.

Rogerson," I asked him sweetly as we sat watching a video in the pool house, "where would I find the pelagic zone?"
"In the open sea," he said. "Now shut up and eat your Junior Mints.

It is a very natural human trait to destroy that which frightens us.

It is one of the beautiful compensations of life that no man can sincerely try to help another without helping himself.

the purpose of life is the life of purpose

Were I a Roman Catholic, perhaps I should on this occasion vow to build a chapel to some saint, but as I am not, if I were to vow at all, it should be to build a light-house.
[Letter to his wife, 17 July 1757, after narrowly avoiding a shipwreck; often misquoted as "Lighthouses are more helpful than churches."]

The downfall of the attempts of governments and leaders to unite mankind is found in this- in the wrong message that we should see everyone as the same. This is the root of the failure of harmony. Because the truth is, we should not all see everyone as the same! We are not the same! We are made of different colours and we have different cultures. We are all different! But the key to this door is to look at these differences, respect these differences, learn from and about these differences, and grow in and with these differences. We are all different. We are not the same. But that's beautiful. And that's okay.In the quest for unity and peace, we cannot blind ourselves and expect to be all the same. Because in this, we all have an underlying belief that everyone should be the same as us at some point. We are not on a journey to become the same or to be the same. But we are on a journey to see that in all of our differences, that is what makes us beautiful as a human race, and if we are ever to grow, we ought to learn and always learn some more.

The Man who says he can, and the man who says he can not.. Are both correct

Why am I compelled to write?... Because the world I create in the writing compensates for what the real world does not give me. By writing I put order in the world, give it a handle so I can grasp it. I write because life does not appease my appetites and anger... To become more intimate with myself and you. To discover myself, to preserve myself, to make myself, to achieve self-autonomy. To dispell the myths that I am a mad prophet or a poor suffering soul. To convince myself that I am worthy and that what I have to say is not a pile of shit... Finally I write because I'm scared of writing, but I'm more scared of not writing.

Though we tremble before uncertain futures
may we meet illness, death and adversity with strength
may we dance in the face of our fears.


The primary thing when you take a sword in your hands is your intention to cut the enemy, whatever the means. Whenever you parry, hit, spring, strike or touch the enemy's cutting sword, you must cut the enemy in the same movement. It is essential to attain this. If you think only of hitting, springing, striking or touching the enemy, you will not be able actually to cut him.

Loneliness and the feeling of being unwanted is the most terrible poverty.

Your opinion is not my reality.

After all, if you do not resist the apparently inevitable, you will never know how inevitable the inevitable was.

The doubters said,
 "Man can not fly,"
 The doers said,
 "Maybe, but we'll try,"
 And finally soared
 In the morning glow
 While non-believers
 Watched from below.

We're so engaged in doing things to achieve purposes of outer value that we forget the inner value, the rapture that is associated with being alive, is what it is all about.

Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

The purpose of literature is to turn blood into ink.

People live their lives bound by what they accept as correct and true. Thatâs how they define Reality. But what does it mean to be âcorrectâ or âtrueâ? Merely vague conceptsâ¦ Their Reality may all be a mirage. Can we consider them to simply be living in their own world, shaped by their beliefs?

To every problem, there is a most simple solution.

On no subject are our ideas more warped and pitiable than on death. ... Let children walk with nature, let them see the beautiful blendings and communions of death and life, their joyous inseparable unity, as taught in woods and meadows, plains and mountains and streams of our blessed star, and they will learn that death is stingless indeed, and as beautiful as life, and that the grave has no victory, for it never fights.

If we bear all this suffering and if there are still Jews left, when it is over, then Jews, instead of being doomed, will be held up as an example.

You have a unique gift to offer this world. Be true to yourself, be kind to yourself, read and learn about everything that interests you and keep away from people who bring you down. When you treat yourself kindly and respect the uniqueness of those around you, you will be giving this world an amazing gift... YOU!

There are not enough days in forever to allow me to fully express the depth of my love for you.

As for what it's against - the story is against those who pervert and misuse religion, or any other kind of doctrine with a holy book and a priesthood and an apparatus of power that wields unchallengeable authority, in order to dominate and suppress human freedoms.

My life is very monotonous," the fox said. "I hunt chickens: men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life. I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow. And then look: you see the grain fields down yonder? [...] The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the color of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back to the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wheat in the wind...

Nobody is exempt from the trials of life, but everyone can always find something positive in everything even in the worst of times.

I donât want anyone to hold back who they are. Itâs not okayâ¦ itâs not a good thing

Don't go on discussing what a good person should be. Just be one.

Vote for the man who promises least; he'll be the least disappointing.

Successful people have libraries. The rest have big screen TVs

Storms make trees take deeper roots.

When life doesn't meet your expectations, it was important to take it with grace.

Once for all, then, a short precept is given thee: Love, and do what thou wilt: whether thou hold thy peace, through love hold thy peace; whether thou cry out, through love cry out; whether thou correct, through love correct; whether thou spare, through love do thou spare: let the root of love be within, of this root can nothing spring but what is good.

Day after day, day after day,
We stuck, nor breath nor motion;
As idle as a painted ship
Upon a painted ocean.

Feel your emotions,
Live true your passions,
Keep still your mind.

We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.

When I try, I fail. 
When I trust, 
He succeeds.

Realize that true happiness lies within you. Waste no time and effort searching for peace and contentment and joy in the world outside. Remember that there is no happiness in having or in getting, but only in giving. Reach out. Share. Smile. Hug. Happiness is a perfume you cannot pour on others without getting a few drops on yourself.

Were knowledge all, what were our need
To thrill and faint and sweetly bleed?

impossible is not a word

Do not fear the thorns in your path, for they draw only corrupt blood.

We cannot have a world where everyone is a victim. "I'm this way because my father made me this way. I'm this way because my husband made me this way." Yes, we are indeed formed by traumas that happen to us. But then you must take charge, you must take over, you are responsible.

Don't be afraid of the shadows, that only means there's a light nearby.

It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest most uninteresting person you can talk to may one day be a creature which,if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship, or else a horror and a corruption such as you now meet, if at all, only in a nightmare. All day long we are, in some degree helping each other to one or the other of these destinations. It is in the light of these overwhelming possibilities, it is with the awe and the circumspection proper to them, that we should conduct all of our dealings with one another, all friendships, all loves, all play, all politics. There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations - these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub, and exploit - immortal horrors or everlasting splendors.

Hiduplah Untuk Memberi yang Sebanyak-banyaknya, Bukan untuk Menerima yang Sebanyak-banyaknya. (Pak Harfan)

Do not become someone else just because you are hurt. Be who you are & smile, it may solve, all problems you have got.

Life is full of beauty. Notice it. Notice the bumble bee, the small child, and the smiling faces. Smell the rain, and feel the wind. Live your life to the fullest potential, and fight for your dreams.

The level of success you achieve will be in direct proportion to the depth of your commitment.

The whole summer lay ahead of us-time to rest, time to wait. And when the future comes-no matter what comes with it-I'll be smarter. I'll be stronger. I'll be ready.

We spend money that we do not have, on things we do not need, to impress people who do not care.

Yes, terrible things happen, but sometimes those terrible things- they save you.

it takes as much courage to have tried and failed as it does to have tried and succeded.

Spirituality is not to be learned by flight from the world, or by running away from things, or by turning solitary and going apart from the world. Rather, we must learn an inner solitude wherever or with whomsoever we may be. We must learn to penetrate things and find God there.

For those who know the value of and exquisite taste of solitary freedom (for one is only free when alone), the act of leaving is the bravest and most beautiful of all.

Now you people have names. That's because you don't know who you are. We know who we are, so we don't need names.

Iâd rather welcome change than cling to the past.

Four things to learn in life: To think clearly without hurry or confusion; To love everybody sincerely; To act in everything with the highest motives; To trust God unhesitatingly.

Dance like you're stamping on a human face forever, love like you've been in a serious car crash that minced the front of your brain, stab like no one can arrest you, and live like there's no such thing as God.

Don't let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do. 

Love cures people, both the ones who give it and the ones who receive it.

If you donât have the time to do something right, where are you going to find the time to fix it?

I will be generous with my love today. I will sprinkle compliments and uplifting words everywhere I go. I will do this knowing that my words are like seeds and when they fall on fertile soil, a reflection of those seeds will grow into something greater.

It's been said that love finds you when you're ready.

The universe is big. It's vast and complicated and ridiculous. And sometimesâvery rarelyâimpossible things just happen and we call them miracles.

A great human revolution in just a single individual will help achieve a change in the destiny of a nation and, further, can even enable a change in the destiny of all humankind.

Mother is a verb. It's something you do. Not just who you are.

The true miracle lies in our eagerness to allow, appreciate, and honor the uniqueness, and freedom of each sentient being to sing the song of their heart.

She was broken, I think itâs because she loved too much and she was always blind to the fact that love too is sometimes broken.

To me, when someone wrongs you, you both share the burden of that wrongdoing - the pain of it weighs on both of you. Forgiveness, then, means choosing to bear the full weight all by yourself. Caleb's betrayal is something we both carry, and since he did it, all I've wanted is for him to take its weight away from me. I am not sure that I'm capable of shouldering it all myself - not sure that I am strong enough, or good enough.

When I pictured myself, it was always like just an outline in a colouring book, with the inside not yet completed.

This new day has greeted us with no rules; unconditional opportunity. Do not dilute the power of this new day with the hardship of yesterday. Greet this day the way it has greeted you; with open arms and endless possibility.

One of the best ways to influence people is to make those around you feel important.

So long as you fight the darkness, you stand in the light.

We never know how high we are till we are called to rise. Then if we are true to form our statures touch the skies.

Brimstone once told me that to stay true in the face of evil is a feat of strength.

Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing.

Every challenge you face today makes you stronger tomorrow. The challenge of life is intended to make you better, not bitter.

I cannot trust a man to control others who cannot control himself.

There is
a time to live
and a time to die
but never to reject the moment.

Something amazing happens when you're in love and don't give a damn about what day it is anymore.

People are always telling me that i'm not like other girls...that i dont dress like other girls...that i dont act like other girls. But i'm my OWN person...i go to the beat of my own drum.

In the end, everything is a gag.

I don't think we get answers to every question. We don't get all the whys. But I think when we look back to the end of our lives, if we do the best we can, and we will see that the things we begged God to take from us, the things we cursed him for, the things that made us turn our backs on him, are the things that were the biggest blessings, the biggest opportunities for growth.

Man jadda wajada
Siapa yang bersungguh - sungguh, akan berhasil

So what? You're another person, so of course you look different. What do you need to be ashamed for?

We're called to be faithful, to take those first difficult steps--and to leave the results up to God.

Things will change: you won't feel this way forever. And anyway, sometimes the hardest lessons to learn are the ones your soul needs most.

To separate oneself from the burden, the angst, the anguish that we all encounter everyday. To say I am alive, I am wonderful, I am. I am. That is something to aspire to.

What she had long believed was not true, and now the world was wide open to discover what was.
It is like all my life I thought the sky was green.

It occurred to me by intuition, and music was the driving force behind that intuition. My discovery was the result of musical perception.

Every time I thought I was being rejected from something good, I was actually being re-directed to something better.

Quiet people have the loudest minds.

I don't regret the painful times; I bare my scars as if they were medals.

Woman is a delicate creature with strong emotions who has been created by the Almighty God to shoulder responsibility for educating society and moving toward perfection. God created woman as symbol of His own beauty and to give solace to her partner and her family.

âToday is a new day. It's a day you have never seen before and will never see again. Stop telling yourself the 'same crap, different day' lie! How many days has that lie stolen from you? Seize the wonder and uniqueness of today! Recognize that throughout this beautiful day, you have an incredible amount of opportunities to move your life into the direction you want it to go.

A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality.

I want you to have big dreams, big goals. I want you to strive to achieve them. But I don't want to see you beating yourself up every time you make a mistake.

And the fox said to the little prince: men have forgotten this truth, but you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.

Indeed, the more we find to love, the more we add to the measure of our hearts.

Holding a grudge & harboring anger/resentment is poison to the soul. Get even with people...but not those who have hurt us, forget them, instead get even with those who have helped us.

God is God. He knows what he is doing. When you canât trace his hand, trust his heart.

Love feels no burden, thinks nothing of its trouble, attempts what is above its strength, pleads no excuse for impossibility, for it thinks all things are lawful for itself and all things are possible

Pegang tanganku, tapi jangan terlalu erat, karena aku ingin seiring dan bukan digiring.(Spasi)

You have every right to a beautiful life.

How does one become a butterfly? They have to want to learn to fly so much that you are willing to give up being a caterpillar.

Never let anybody guess that you have a mind of your own. Above all be pure

I realize that life is risks. Itâs acknowledging the past but looking forward. Itâs taking a chance that we will
make mistakes but believing that we all deserve to be forgiven.

We have just enough religion to make us hate, but not enough to make us love one another.

It is our wounds that create in us a desire to reach for miracles. The fulfillment of such miracles depends on whether we let our wounds pull us down or lift us up towards our dreams.

Happiness depends more on the inward disposition of mind than on outward circumstances.

I do like the world quite a lot.

Onward and Upward! To Narnia and the North!

Go and get your things,' he said. 'Dreams mean work.

Me plus you. (Imma tell you one time) Me plus you. (Imma tell you one time)
Me plus you. (Imma tell you one time)
One time. 
When I met ya girl my heart when knock (knock knock) 
Now them butterflies in my stomach won't stop (stop stop) 
Even love is a struggle and it's all we got. 
So we gun keep keep climbing to the mountain top. 
'Cause your world, is my world, and my breath is your breath, and my heart is yours...

I can't understand why people are frightened of new ideas. I'm frightened of the old ones.

All I have is all I need and all I need is all I have in this moment.

A successful marriage requires falling in love many times -- always with the same person.

she lived with hurricane eyes and fell in love with the way the waves collapsed against her cheeks.

A graceful refusal is better than a lengthy promise.

But there's always a first time for everything

This was not a fearie tale. This was not the movies. This was life. It hurt more. It was excruciating. It was excruciatingly beautiful.

The strength of a man isn't seen in the power of his arms. It's seen in the love with which he EMBRACES you.

I don't think you should wait. I think you should speak now.

No matter who we are, no matter what our circumstances, our feelings and emotions are universal. And music has always been a great way to make people aware of that connection. It can help you open up a part of yourself and express feelings you didn't know you were feeling. It's risky to let that happen. But it's a risk you have to take-because only then will you find you're not alone.

Everything will be alright in the end so if it is not alright it is not the end.

In your own life it's important to know how spectacular you are.

It is this belief in a power larger than myself and other than myself which allows me to venture into the unknown and even the unknowable.

God is whispering in your heart, in the whole existence, just tune your ears.

The greatest blessing granted to mankind come by way of madness, which is a divine gift.

You have forgotten the One
who doesn't care about ownership,
who doesn't try to turn a profit
from every human exchange.

We donât truly appreciate what we have until itâs goneâ¦ We donât really appreciate something until we have experienced some events; we don't really appreciate our parents until we ourselves have become parents. Be grateful for what you have now, and nothing should be taken for granted.

I know I'm not going to be in your head all the time. But once you know me, I'll be forever in your heart.Â 

Hard times build determination and inner strength. Through them we can also come to appreciate the uselessness of anger. Instead of getting angry nurture a deep caring and respect for troublemakers because by creating such trying circumstances they provide us with invaluable opportunities to practice tolerance and patience.

When God had made The Man, he made him out of stuff that sung all the time and glittered all over. Some angels got jealous and chopped him into millions of pieces, but still he glittered and hummed. So they beat him down to nothing but sparks but each little spark had a shine and a song. So they covered each one over with mud. And the lonesomeness in the sparks make them hunt for one another.

Wherever men and women are persecuted because of their race, religion, or political views, that place must â at that moment â become the center of the universe.

I believe in some blending of hope and sunshine sweetening the worst lots. I believe that this life is not all; neither the beginning nor the end. I believe while I tremble; I trust while I weep.

What you do is what matters, not what you think or say or plan.

Self-esteem comes from being able to define the world in your own terms and refusing to abide by the judgments of others.

You need just the right amount of 'Fuck the world' and the right amount of belief in something...and you need the right amount of love.

Nobody gets praised for the right reasons.

I am an optimist... I choose to be. There is a lot of darkness in our world, there is a lot of pain and you can choose to see that or you can choose to see the joy. If you try to respond positively to the world, you will spend your time better.

Can a dream be wrong? Aren't dreams God's way of telling you things?

Truth builds trust.

The dream was always running ahead of me. To catch up, to live for a moment in unison, was the miracle.

Here lies one whose name was writ on water.

Until you have suffered much in your heart, you cannot learn humility.

We are constantly invited to be what we are.

Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be?

Sometimes success isn't about making the right decision, it's more about making some decision.

May the fleas of a thousand camels invade the crotch of the person that ruins your day. And may their arms be to short too scratch

Fear defeats more people than any other one thing in the world.

Life doesn't just happen to you; you
receive everything in your life based on what you've given.

I am not a victim. No matter what I have been through, I'm still here. I have a history of victory.

Happiness is a state of mind, a choice, a way of living; it is not something to be achieved, it is something to be experienced.

I can tell you I love you as many times as you can stand to hear it, but all it does is remind us that love is not enough. Not even close.

Living never wore one so much as the effort not to live.

I wish that all nations may recover and retain their independence; that those which are overgrown may not advance beyond safe measures of power, that a salutary balance may be ever maintained among nations, and that our peace, commerce, and friendship, may be sought and cultivated by all. It is our business to manufacture for ourselves whatever we can, to keep our markets open for what we can spare or want; and the less we have to do with the amities or enmities of Europe, the better. Not in our day, but at no distant one, we may shake a rod over the heads of all, which may make the stoutest of them tremble.

If you remember nothing else, remember this: Inspiration from outside one's self is like the heat in an oven. It makes passable Bath buns. But inspiration from within is like a volcano: It changes the face of the world.

Biarkan orang lain menjalani kehidupan yang kecil, tetapi kamu jangan!
Biarkan orang lain memperdebatkan soal-soal kecil, tetapi kamu jangan!
Biarkan orang lain menangisik kepedihan-kepedihan kecil, tetapi kamu jangan!
Biarkan orang lain menyerahkan masa depan mereka kepada orang lain, tetapi kamu jangan!

The story of my recent life.' I like that phrase. It makes more sense than 'the story of my life', because we get so many lives between birth and death. A life to be a child. A life to come of age. A life to wander, to settle, to fall in love, to parent, to test our promise, to realize our mortality- and in some lucky cases, to do something after that realization.

Strength is Life, Weakness is Death.
Expansion is Life, Contraction is Death.
Love is Life, Hatred is Death.

When I hear music, I fear no danger. I am invulnerable. I see no foe. I am related to the earliest times, and to the latest.

Faster, Faster, until the thrill of speed overcomes the fear of death.

What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?

It used to be about trying to do something. Now it's about trying to be someone.

Sometimes we know in our bones what we really need to do, but we're afraid to do it. Taking a chance and stepping beyond the safety of the world we've always known is the only way to grow, though and without risk there is no reward.

Maybe 'Okay' will be our 'always'...

The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'.

Love was that way. You could not render it in black or white. It always came down to the strange, blended shades of grey.

The cause of most of man's unhappiness is sacrificing what he wants most for what he wants now.

In this country we have no place for hyphenated Americans.

Anything that you learn becomes your wealth, a wealth that cannot be taken away from you; whether you learn it in a building called school or in the school of life. To learn something new is a timeless pleasure and a valuable treasure. And not all things that you learn are taught to you, but many things that you learn you realize you have taught yourself.

It was stupid to hope, she knew. But sometimes hope was all you had.

You will write if you will write without thinking of the result in terms of a result, but think of the writing in terms of discovery, which is to say that creation must take place 
between the pen and the paper, not before in a thought or afterwards in a recasting... 
It will come if it is there and if you will let it come.

The atheist staring from his attic window is often nearer to God than the believer caught up in his own false image of God.

I shut my eyes in order to see.

There is nothing more important than your eternal salvation.

We had the experience but missed the meaning. And approach to the meaning restores the experience in a different form.

Make your interactions with people transformational, not just transactional.

Never miss an opportunity to show your love, especially to those close to you, because we are always at our most cautious with them for fear of being hurt.

A truth that no one knows is still the truth.

I wish I could make him understand that a loving good heart is riches enough, and that without it intellect is poverty.

We live out our lives as we are meant to live them-with some choice, with some chance, but mostly as a result of the persons we are.

Seven years, Dawn. Working with the Slayer. Seeing my friends get more and more powerful... a witch. A demon. Hell, I could fit Oz in my shaving kit, but come a full moon, he had a wolfy mojo not to be messed with. Powerful, all of them. And I'm the guy who fixes the windows. 
They'll never know how tough it is, Dawnie, to be the one who isn't Chosen, to live so near the spotlight and never step in it. But I know. I see more than anybody realizes because nobody's watching me. 
I saw you last night, and I see you working here today. You're not special; you're extraordinary.

Books have a way of finding their way into our lives, usually, right when we need them the most.

Itâs funny, for all it took was a broken heart and that alone was enough, enough for her to do everything she ever dreamed of.

If I lived a million lives, I would've felt a million feelings and I still would've fallen a million times for you.

Adversity is a natural part of being human. It is the height of arrogance to prescribe a moral code or health regime or spiritual practice as an amulet to keep things from falling apart. Things do fall apart. It is in their nature to do so. When we try to protect ourselves from the inevitability of change, we are not listening to the soul. We are listening to our fear of life and death, our lack of faith, our smaller ego's will to prevail. To listen to your soul is to stop fighting with life--to stop fighting when things fall apart; when they don't go our away, when we get sick, when we are betrayed or mistreated or misunderstood. To listen to the soul is to slow down, to feel deeply, to see ourselves clearly, to surrender to discomfort and uncertainty and to wait.

Tell all the Truth but tell it slant--
Success in Circuit lies
Too bright for our infirm Delight
The Truth's superb surprise
As Lightning to the Children eased
With explanation kind
The Truth must dazzle gradually
Or every man be blind--

If everyone helps to hold up the sky, then one person does not become tired.

Donât allow yourself to become disheartened when the thread doesnât suit or seems unsightly to you. Wait and watch. Be patient and devoted. As the threads twist and turn, you will begin to understand, and you will see the pattern finally materialize in all its splendor.

In a strong relationship, you should love your companion more than you need them.

One of the great liabilities of history is that all too many people fail to remain awake through great periods of social change. Every society has its protectors of status quo and its fraternities of the indifferent who are notorious for sleeping through revolutions. Today, our very survival depends on our ability to stay awake, to adjust to new ideas, to remain vigilant and to face the challenge of change.

It`s not how old you are, it`s how you are old.

Nobody sees a flower - really - it is so small it takes time - we haven't time - and to see takes time, like to have a friend takes time.

The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want for nothing. He makes me lie down in the green pastures. He greases up my head with oil. He gives me kung-fu in the face of my enemies. Amen

I have already settled it for myself so flattery and criticism go down the same drain and I am quite free.

One of the penalties of an ecological education is that one lives alone in a world of wounds. Much of the damage inflicted on land is quite invisible to laymen. An ecologist must either harden his shell and make believe that the consequences of science are none of his business, or he must be the doctor who sees the marks of death in a community that believes itself well and does not want to be told otherwise.

The victim mindset dilutes the human potential. By not accepting personal responsibility for our circumstances, we greatly reduce our power to change them.

There are no traffic jams on the extra mile.

Let us pick up our books and our pens,â I said. âThey are our most powerful weapons. One child, one teacher, one book and one pen can change the world.

He who robs us of our dreams robs us of our life.

Be a true Heart, not a follower.

You know me better than you think, you know, and you shall know me better yet.

Do you train for passing tests or do you train for creative inquiry?

You must remember what you are and what you have chosen to become, and the significance of what you are doing. There are wars and defeats and victories of the human race that are not military and that are not recorded in the annals of history. Remember that while you're trying to decide what to do.

The wise warrior avoids the battle.

Life consists of what man is thinking about all day.

the moment you don't feel like praying, get on your knees. And the moment you don't feel like reading your bible, you'd better get that Book open.

I had always had a little problem looking out for myself in love. I was afraid people would leave me. So I sort of clung and did everything possible to keep someone around. I didn't have a hard talk with myself about who I was keeping around. Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out. I clung to people like human life preservers. I thought i'd die if someone left me. Its ironic because now I'm the one who's leaving.

You can never cross the ocean until you have the courage to lose sight of the shore

It may not feel too classy, begging just to eat 
But you know who does that?
Lassie, and she always gets a treat 
So you wonder what your part is 
Because you're homeless and depressed But home is where the heart is 
So your real home's in your chest 
Everyone's a hero in their own way Everyone's got villains they must face 
They're not as cool as mine 
But folks you know it's fine to know your place 
Everyone's a hero in their own way 
In their own not-that-heroic way 
So I thank my girlfriend Penny 
Yeah, we totally had sex 
She showed me there's so many different muscles I can flex 
There's the deltoids of compassion, 
There's the abs of being kind 
It's not enough to bash in heads
You've got to bash in minds 
Everyone's a hero in their own way Everyone's got something they can do Get up go out and fly 
Especially that guy, he smells like poo 
Everyone's a hero in their own way 
You and you and mostly me and you 
I'm poverty's new sheriff 
And I'm bashing in the slums 
A hero doesn't care if you're a bunch of scary alcoholic bums 
Everybody! 
Everyone's a hero in their own way Everyone can blaze a hero's trail 
Don't worry if it's hard 
If you're not a friggin 'tard you will prevail 
Everyone's a hero in their own way Everyone's a hero in their...

I was good and bad, but never wicked.

No man is free who is not master of himself.

Our men think earning money and ordering around others is where power lies. They don't think power is in the hands of the woman who takes care of everyone all day long, and gives birth to their children.

I don't believe in hate. To me it wastes too much time. People who hate waste so much of their life hating that they miss out on all the other stuff out here.

Nobody ever lives their life all the way up except bullfighters.

The more you talk about them, the more important they will feel. The more you listen to them, the more important you will make them feel.

Real change is difficult at the beginning, but gorgeous at the end. Change begins the moment you get the courage and step outside your comfort zone; change begins at the end of your comfort zone.

Time is what keeps things from happening all at once.

And if these mountains had eyes, they would wake to find two strangers in their fences, standing in admiration as a breathing red pours its tinge upon earth's shore. These mountains, which have seen untold sunrises, long to thunder praise but stand reverent, silent so that man's weak praise should be given God's attention.

None of us will ever accomplish anything excellent or commanding except when he listens to this whisper which is heard by him alone.

Never apologize for showing feeling. When you do so, you apologize for the truth.

I am still determined to be cheerful and happy, in whatever situation I may be; for I have also learned from experience that the greater part of our happiness or misery depends upon our dispositions, and not upon our circumstances. a

You know my name, not my story. You've heard what I've done, but not what I've been through.

The heart may freeze, or it can burn. The pain will ease and I can learn. There is no future, there is no past. I live this moment as, my last.

Do what you love, think what you feel and live the way you want.

To be heroic is to be courageous enough to die for something; to be inspirational is to be crazy enough to live a little.

The dictionary is the only place that success comes before work. work is the key to success, and hard work can help you accomplish anything.

God only allows us to see such things when he wants something to change

It does not matter how long you live, but how well you do it.

If your life is worth thinking about,it is worth writing about.

Quit being so hard on yourself. We are what we are; we love what we love. We don't need to justify it to anyone... not even to ourselves.

You do not have to sit outside in the dark. If, however, you want to look at the stars, you will find that darkness is necessary. But the stars neither require nor demand it.

A daily dose of daydreaming heals the heart, soothes the soul, and strengthens the imagination.

A child fish asks mother fish, 'Mother, why cannot we live on the Earth?' Mother fish replied, 'Dearâ¦ it is not the place for fish, it is the place for selfish

You are a human with one life and its up to you to make it the best life you can.

You told me once of the plants that lie dormant through the drought, that wait, half-dead, deep in the earth. The plants that wait for the rain. You said they'd wait for years, if they had to; that they'd almost kill themselves before they grew again. But as soon as those first drops of water fall, those plants begin to stretch and spread their roots. They travel up through the soil and sand to reach the surface. There's a chance for them again.

If you would not be forgotten, as soon as you are dead and rotten, either write things worth reading, or do things worth writing.

People who love themselves come across as very loving, generous and kind; they express their self-confidence through humility, forgiveness and inclusiveness.

I would not sit waiting for some vague tomorrow, nor for something to happen. One could wait a lifetime, and find nothing at the end of the waiting. I would begin here, I would make something happen.

there is no moment more precious than the exact moment you are living now

Tough times don't last, tough people do, remember?

The major work of the world is not done by geniuses. It is done by ordinary people, with balance in their lives, who have learned to work in an extraordinary manner.

Inner peace is impossible without patience. Wisdom requires patience. Spiritual growth implies the mastery of patience. Patience allows the unfolding of destiny to proceed at its won unhurried pace.

Don't lose heart if it's very difficult at times, everything will come out all right and nobody can in the beginning do as he wishes.

If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader.

And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.... Don't settle

Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.

Death is nothing at all. It does not count. I have only slipped away into the next room. Nothing has happened. Everything remains exactly as it was. I am I, and you are you, and the old life that we lived so fondly together is untouched, unchanged. Whatever we were to each other, that we are still. Call me by the old familiar name. Speak of me in the easy way which you always used. Put no difference into your tone. Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow. Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together. Play, smile, think of me, pray for me. Let my name be ever the household word that it always was. Let it be spoken without an effort, without the ghost of a shadow upon it. Life means all that it ever meant. It is the same as it ever was. There is absolute and unbroken continuity. What is this death but a negligible accident? Why should I be out of mind because I am out of sight? I am but waiting for you, for an interval, somewhere very near, just round the corner. All is well. Nothing is hurt; nothing is lost. One brief moment and all will be as it was before. How we shall laugh at the trouble of parting when we meet again!

The world takes us to a silver screen on which flickering images of passion and romance play, and as we watch, the world says, âThis is love.â God takes us to the foot of a tree on which a naked and bloodied man hangs and says, âThis is love.

If you want something you can have it, but only if you want everything that goes with it, including all the hard work and the despair, and only if you're willing to risk failure. 

If you have the guts to be yourself, other people'll pay your price.

Love me or hate me I promise that it will never make or break me...<3

Understanding is the reward of faith. Therefore, seek not to understand that you may believe, but believe that you may understand.

People will always have opinions about your decision because they're not courageous enough to take action on their opinion.

Never give up. 
It's like breathingâonce you quit, your flame dies letting total darkness extinguish every last gasp of hope. You can't do that. You must continue taking in even the shallowest of breaths, continue putting forth even the smallest of efforts to sustain your dreams. Don't ever, ever, ever give up.

So, have we solved the secret of happiness?
"I believe so," he said
Are you going to tell me?
"Yes.Ready?"
Ready.
"Be satisfied."
That's it?
"Be greatful."
That's it?
"For what you have.For the love you receive.And for what God has given you."
That's it?
He looked me in the eye.Then he sighed deeply.
"That's it.

It is when we think we can act like God, that all respect is lost, and I think this is the downfall of peace. We lie if we say we do not see color and culture and difference. We fool ourselves and cheat ourselves when we say that all of us are the same. We should not want to be the same as others and we should not want others to be the same as us. Rather, we ought to glory and shine in all of our differences, flaunting them fabulously for all to see! It is never a conformity that we need! We need not to conform! What we need is to burst out into all these beautiful colors!

Loyalty and obedience to wisdom and justice are fine; but it is still finer to defy arbitrary power, unjustly and cruelly used--not on behalf of ourselves, but on behalf of others more helpless.

There is no point in keeping vengeance or stubbornness. These things" -he sighed- "these things I so regret in my life. Pride. Vanity. Why do we do the things we do? 
Morrie Schwartz

The summit of happiness is reached when a person is ready to be what he is.

Fairness does not mean everyone gets the same. Fairness means everyone gets what they need.

Never follow the crowd.

Have love for your inner Self and everything else is done for you.

Some days are like this. And the only way to get through them is to remember that they are only one day, and that every day ends.

We are not helpless...Many times in our lives weâve been powerless, but not this night. Right now we have the power to choose the manner in which we die. If you have been a master of nothing else in all your days, you are now a master of this moment. And I for one am going to give such an answer to this insult that others will dearly regret not being by my side to see it!

Most people think happiness is about gaining something, but it's not. It's all about getting rid of the darkness you accumulate.

Society will always be too fragile to accept us for all that makes us beautiful.

when you're cool for twenty,
you get paid for twenty-one.

I feel infinite.

Appreciate the moment of a first kiss; it may be the last time you own your heart.

Madness and chaos are self-destructing but over thinking is the suicide.

(Voyager, there are no bridges, one builds them as one walks.) 

We have all forgotten what we really are. All that we call common sense and rationality and practicality and positivism only means that for certain dead levels of our life we forget that we have forgotten. All that we call spirit and art and ecstasy only means that for one awful instant we remember that we forget.

Hearts can't be broken because they're made of marzipan.

If you're really listening, if you're awake to the poignant beauty of the world, your heart breaks regularly. In fact, your heart is made to break; its purpose is to burst open again and again so that it can hold evermore wonders.

The most important thing is this: to be able at any moment to be free to choose a life that makes you happy.

If you can't do great things, do small things in a great way.

You don't need anybody to tell you who you are or what you are. You are what you are!

That's a misconception, Lennie. The sky is everywhere, it begins at your feet.

You are not here merely to make a living. You are here in order to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, with a finer spirit of hope and achievement. You are here to enrich the world, and you impoverish yourself if you forget the errand.

A man can't soar too high, when he flies with his own wings.

If we tend to the things that are important in life, if we are right with those we love, and behave in line with our faith, our lives will not be cursed with the aching throb of unfulfilled business. Our words will always be sincere, our embraces will be tight. We will never wallow in the agony of âI could have, I should haveâ. We can sleep in a storm. And when its time, our goodbyes will be complete.

It doesn't matter who you are, or where you come from, or how much money you've got in your pocket. You have your own destiny and your own life ahead of you.

You can't go home again

To read is to empower,
To empower is to write,
To write is to influence,
To influence is to change,
To change is to live".

Faith is deliberate confidence in the character of God whose ways you may not understand at the time.

Leaders are limited by their vision rather than by their abilities.

Fear not the path of Truth for the lack of People walking on it.

When someone is trying very hard to get something, they don't. And when they're running away from something as hard as they can, it usually catches up with them.

Keep me up till five because all your stars are out, and for no other reasonâ¦Oh dare to do it Buddy! Trust your heart. Youâre a deserving craftsman. It would never betray you. Good night. Iâm feeling very much over-excited now, and a little dramatic, but I think Iâd give almost anything on earth to see you writing a something, an anything, a poem, a tree, that was really and truly after your own heart.

Di jalan cinta para pejuang, biarkan cinta berhenti di titik ketaatan.. Meloncati rasa suka dan tidak suka.. Melampaui batas cinta dan benci.. Karena hikmah sejati tak selalu terungkap di awal pagi.. Karena seringkali kebodohan merabunkan kesan sesaat.. Maka taat adalah prioritas yang kadang membuat perasaan-perasaan terkibas.. Tapi yakinlah, di jalan cinta para pejuang, Alloh lebih tahu tentang kita..

You only get one life. Live it to the fullest. All your miseries will be forgiven when you will be dead.

Always be like a water. Float in the times of pain or dance like waves along the wind which touches its surface.

What is grander than a country and more valuable than gold? Strength of heart.

Seberapa indah mimpi, jika tetap mimpi?

Faith is like radar that sees through the fog -- the reality of things at a distance that the human eye cannot see.

How strange is man that when he is afraid of something he runs away from it, but when he is afraid of Allah, he gets closer to Him.

It is when things are at worst you will get the best.

Adversity introduces a man to himself.

And so I ask myself: 'Where are your dreams?' And I shake my head and mutter: 'How the years go by!' And I ask myself again: 'What have you done with those years? Where have you buried your best moments? Have you really lived? Look,' I say to myself, 'how cold it is becoming all over the world!' And more years will pass and behind them will creep grim isolation. Tottering senility will come hobbling, leaning on a crutch, and behind these will come unrelieved boredom and despair. The world of fancies will fade, dreams will wilt and die and fall like autumn leaves from the trees. . . .

If you're serious about sanctification, you can expect to experience heart-wrenching moments that try your faith, your endurance, and your patience.

The reward of a thing well done is having done it.

The truth is I didnât need therapy; I just needed to feel loved and know that someone out there craved my attention.

The most basic and powerful way to connect to another person is to listen. Just listen. Perhaps the most important thing we ever give each other is our attentionâ¦. A loving silence often has far more power to heal and to connect than the most well-intentioned words. 

The institutions of human society treat us as parts of a machine. They assign us ranks and place considerable pressure upon us to fulfill defined roles. We need something to help us restore our lost and distorted humanity. Each of us has feelings that have been suppressed and have built up inside. There is a voiceless cry resting in the depths of our souls, waiting for expression. Art gives the soul's feelings voice and form.

You must learn to take a step back and visualize the whole piece. If you focus only on the thread given to you, you lose sight of what it can become. 

Maybe we've lived a thousand lives before this one and in each of them we've found each other... I know I've spent each life before this one searching for you. Not someone like you but you, for your soul and mine must always come together.

If through a broken heart God can bring His purposes to pass in the world, then thank Him for breaking your heart.

If you can't be honest with your friends and colleagues and loved ones, then what is life all about?

The motive behind criticism often determines its validity. Those who care criticize where necessary. Those who envy criticize the moment they think that they have found a weak spot.

There had been times when he knew, somewhere in him, that he would get used to it, whatever it was, because he had learnt that some hard things became softer after a very little while.

The difference we wanna make is number one to let these kids know that theyâre not alone, that theyâre actually not that messed up and that they can do whatever they want; they can express themselves however they want, without being persecuted or called a faggot or some kind of racist thing. You know, really just to get people to get over their stuff so they can live.

Sad stories make good books

What is demanded of man is not, as some existential philosophers teach, to endure the meaninglessness of life, but rather to bear his incapacity to grasp its unconditional meaningfulness in rational terms.

Finding the lesson behind every adversity will be the one important thing that helps get you through it.

Pesimistik tidak lebih daripada sikap takbur mendahului nasib.

The terrible thing, the almost impossible thing, is to hand over your whole self--all your wishes and precautions--to Christ. But it is far easier than what we are all trying to do instead. For what we are trying to do is to remain what we call "ourselves," to keep personal happiness as our great aim in life, and yet at the same time be "good.

The wish to travel seems to me characteristically human: the desire to move, to satisfy your curiosity or ease your fears, to change the circumstances of your life, to be a stranger, to make a friend, to experience an exotic landscape, to risk the unknown..

You will have to make up for the smallness of your size by your courage and selfless devotion to duty, for it is not life that matters, but the courage, fortitude and determination you bring to it.

You have to rise above the squabbling and chaos, and keep believing. You have to always keep your goals in mind.â -Hera, goddess of marriage 

There are people who have money and people who are rich.

Love me when I least deserve it, because that's when I really need it.

Religion can never reform mankind because religion is slavery. It is far better to be free, to leave the forts and barricades of fear, to stand erect and face the future with a smile. It is far better to give yourself sometimes to negligence, to drift with wave and tide, with the blind force of the world, to think and dream, to forget the chains and limitations of the breathing life, to forget purpose and object, to lounge in the picture gallery of the brain, to feel once more the clasps and kisses of the past, to bring life's morning back, to see again the forms and faces of the dead, to paint fair pictures for the coming years, to forget all Gods, their promises and threats, to feel within your veins life's joyous stream and hear the martial music, the rhythmic beating of your fearless heart. And then to rouse yourself to do all useful things, to reach with thought and deed the ideal in your brain, to give your fancies wing, that they, like chemist bees, may find art's nectar in the weeds of common things, to look with trained and steady eyes for facts, to find the subtle threads that join the distant with the now, to increase knowledge, to take burdens from the weak, to develop the brain, to defend the right, to make a palace for the soul. This is real religion. This is real worship

How would your life be different ifâ¦You didnât allow yourself to be defined by your past? Let today be the dayâ¦You stop letting your history interfere with your destiny and awaken to the opportunity to release your greatest self.

You learn to write by writing, and by reading and thinking about how writers have created their characters and invented their stories. If you are not a reader, don't even think about being a writer.

Again and again I will suffer; again and again I will get back on my feet. I will not be defeated. I won't let my spirit be destroyed.

Sameron adion aso
I shall sing a sweeter song tomorrow

Courage to me is doing something daring, no matter how afraid, insecure, intimidated, alone, unworthy, incapable, ridiculed or whatever other paralyzing emotion you might feel. Courage is taking action....no matter what. Â So you're afraid? Be afraid. Â Be scared silly to the point you're trembling and nauseous, but do it anyway!

Don't think of introversion as something that needs to be cured...Spend your free the way you like, not the way you think you're supposed to.

Advice is like snow; the softer it falls, the longer it dwells upon, and the deeper it sinks into the mind.

Child, you have to learn to see things in the right proportions. Learn to see great things great and small things small.

It is our failure to become our perceived ideal that ultimately defines us and makes us unique. It's not easy, but if you accept your misfortune and handle it right your perceived failure can become a catalyst for profound re-invention.

âIn life, at sometime or another we come to a point where all relationships ceaseâwhere there is only us and Allah. There are no parents, brother or sister, or any friend. Then we realise that there is no earth under us nor is there sky above, but only Allah who is supporting us in this emptiness. Then we realise our worth â it is not more than a grain of sand or the leaf of a plant. Then we realise our existence is only confined to our being. Our demise makes not a whit of difference to the world around us, nor to the scheme of things.

Life is All About How you Handle Plan B
Plan A is always my first choice.
You know, the one where
Everything works out to be
Happily ever-after.
But more often than not,
I find myself dealing with
The upside-down, inside-out version --
Where nothing goes as it should.
It's at this point that the real
Test of my character comes in..
Do I sink, or do I swim?
Do I wallow in self pity and play the victim,
Or simply shift gears
And make the best of the situation?
The choice is all mine...
Life is all about how you handle Plan B.

I would court you, with all the grace and courtesy that you deserve,

I had to learn to live without you and I couldn't make sense of it, because I left so much of me inside of you.

Listen to your life. See it for the fathomless mystery it is. In the boredom and pain of it, no less than in the excitement and gladness: touch, taste, smell your way to the holy and hidden heart of it, because in the last analysis all moments are key moments, and life itself is grace.

When we blindly adopt a religion, a political system, a literary dogma, we become automatons.

Where you stumble and fall, there you will find gold.

Don't try to fix me, I'm not broken...

Silence is argument carried out by other means.

I believe that everything that you do bad comes back to you. So everything that I do that's bad, I'm going to suffer from it. But in my mind, I believe what I'm doing is right. So I feel like I'm going to heaven

You can feel the whole world and still feel lost in it. So many people are in pain-- no matter how smart or accomplished--they cry, they yearn, they hurt. But instead of looking down on things, they look up, which is where I should have been looking, too. Because when the world quiets to the sound of your own breathing, we all want the same things: comfort, love and a peaceful heart.

I believe in the hands that work, in the brains that think, and in the hearts that love...I believe in sunshine, fresh air, friendship, calm sleep, beautiful thoughts.

Be the kind of person who dares to face life's challenges and overcome them rather than dodging them.

Sometimes it's the same moments that take your breath away that breathe purpose and love back into your life.

Love, being in love, isnât a constant thing. It doesnât always flow at the same strength. Itâs not always like a river in flood. Itâs more like the sea. It has tides, it ebbs and flows. The thing is, when love is real, whether itâs ebbing or flowing, itâs always there, it never goes away. And thatâs the only proof you can have that it is real, and not just a crush or an infatuation or a passing fancy

Be wary of strong drink, it can make you shoot at the tax collector...and miss.

For the future, the motto is, "No days unalert.

You cannot stay on the summit forever; you have to come down again. So why bother in the first place? Just this: What is above knows what is below, but what is below does not know what is above. One climbs, one sees. One descends, one sees no longer, but one has seen. There is an art of conducting oneself in the lower regions by the memory of what one saw higher up. When one can no longer see, one can at least still know.

I realized then that even though I was a tiny speck in an infinite cosmos, a blip on the timeline of eternity, I was not without purpose.

There are two things that men should never weary of, goodness and humility; we get none too much of them in this rough world among cold, proud people.

He was talking about the sign that said 'THE COMPLICATED FUTILITY OF IGNORANCE.'
'All knew was that I didn't want my daughter or anybody's child to see a message that negative every time she comes into the library,' he said. 'And then I found out it was you who was responsible for it.'
'What's so negative about it?' I said.
'What could be a more negative word than "futility"?' he said.
'"Ignorance,"' I said.

Watch for the thing that will show itself to you. Because that thing, when you find it, will be your future.

Me with nothing left to lose, plotting my big revenge in the spotlight. Give me violent revenge fantasies as a coping mechanism.

Temptation is the feeling we get when encountered by an opportunity to do what we innately know we shouldn't.

In the mist of Difficulty lies Opportunity.

Like a missing tooth, sometimes an absence is more noticeable than a presence.

For all those that have to fight for the respect that everyone else is given without question.

You kick ass Sam. And don't forget it

Remember that things are not always as they appear to beâ¦ Curiosity creates possibilities and opportunities.

There is nothing frightening in the dark if you just face it.

One of the pitfalls of childhood is that one doesn't have to understand something to feel it. By the time the mind is able to comprehend what has happened, the wounds of the heart are already too deep.

The greatest challenge of the day is: how to bring about a revolution of the heart, a revolution which has to start with each one of us?

Love stories are written in millimeters and milliseconds with a fast, dull pencil whose marks you can barely see, they are written in miles and eons with a chisel on the side of a mountiantop

Dive deep. Drown willingly

To save all we must risk all.

There are only two forces at work in this world- black and white. Only people are grey.

The fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.

If you just sit and observe, you will see how restless your mind is. If you try to calm it, it only makes it worse, but over time it does calm, and when it does, there's room to hear more subtle things - that's when your intuition starts to blossom and you start to see things more clearly and be in the present more. Your mind just slows down, and you see a tremendous expanse in the moment. You see so much more than you could see before. It's a discipline; you have to practice it.

What I stand for is what I stand on.

It's a sad day when you find out that it's not accident or time or fortune, but just yourself that kept things from you.

Accept whatever comes to you woven in the pattern of your destiny, for what could more aptly fit your needs?

It's not about finding ways to avoid God's judgment and feeling like a failure if you don't do everything perfectly. It's about fully experiencing God's love and letting it perfect you. It's not about being somebody you are not. It's about becoming who you really are.

Sometimes it falls upon a generation to be great, you can be that generation

It's a beautiful day in this neighborhood,
A beautiful day for a neighbor.
Would you be mine?
Could you be mine?...
It's a neighborly day in this beauty wood,
A neighborly day for a beauty.
Would you be mine?
Could you be mine?...
I've always wanted to have a neighbor just like you.
I've always wanted to live in a neighborhood with you.
So, let's make the most of this beautiful day.
Since we're together we might as well say:
Would you be mine?
Could you be mine?
Won't you be my neighbor?
Won't you please,
Won't you please?
Please won't you be my neighbor?

I want to Live! Not Die, Not Hide, LIVE!

This first glance of a soul which does not yet know itself is like dawn in the heavens; it is the awakening of something radiant and unknown.

I've done my best, and I begin to understand what is meant by 'the joy of strife'. Next to trying and winning, the best thing is trying and failing.

Sugar, it's no parade but you'll get down the street one way or another, so you'd just as well throw your shoulders back and pick up the pace.

Evil exists in us all, Torak. Some fight it. Some feed it. That's how it's always been.

Faith don't come in a bushel basket, Missy. It come one step at a time. Decide to trust Him for one little thing today, and before you know it, you find out He's so trustworthy you be putting your whole life in His hands.

True beauty lies in purity of the heart.

And a beautiful world we live in, when it is possible, and when many other such things are possible, and not only possible, but done-- done, see you!-- under that sky there, every day.

So that's my wish for you, and all of us, and my wish for myself. Make New Mistakes. Make glorious, amazing mistakes. Make mistakes nobody's ever made before. Don't freeze, don't stop, don't worry that it isn't good enough, or it isn't perfect, whatever it is: art, or love, or work or family or life.

Grace isn't a little prayer you chant before receiving a meal. It's a way to live.

If you have not done things worthy of being written about, at least write things worthy of being read.

Enjoy the limitless bliss consciousness here and now. The reality of you lies much beyond your sensory perceptions and boundaries.

Prayer is the sign of your weakness. Rely on your inner strength. You will be the winner.

I never loved another person the way I loved myself.

Do not waste time bothering whether you âloveâ your neighbor; act as if you did. As soon as we do this we find one of the great secrets. When you are behaving as if you loved someone, you will presently come to love him.

But there were some things I believed in. Some things I had faith in. And faith isn't about perfect attendance to services, or how much money you put on the little plate. It isn't about going skyclad to the Holy Rites, or meditating each day upon the divine.
 Faith is about what you do. It's about aspiring to be better and nobler and kinder than you are. It's about making sacrifices for the good of others - even when there's not going to be anyone telling you what a hero you are.

Don't forget your history nor your destiny

Do good, live in the most positive and joyful way possible every day.

Do you know the hallmark of a second rater? It's resentment of another man's achievement. Those touchy mediocrities who sit trembling lest someone's work prove greater than their own - they have no inkling of the loneliness that comes when you reach the top. The loneliness for an equal - for a mind to respect and an achievement to admire. They bare their teeth at you from out of their rat holes,thinking that you take pleasure in letting your brilliance dim them - while you'd give a year of my life to see a flicker of talent anywhere among them. They envy achievement, and their dream of greatness is a world where all men have become their acknowledged inferiors. They don't know that that dream is the infallible proof of mediocrity, because that sort of world is what the man of achievement would not be able to bear. They have no way of knowing what he feels when surrounded by inferiors - hatred? no, not hatred, but boredom - the terrible, hopeless, draining, paralyzing boredom. Of what account are praise and adulation from men whom you don't respect? Have you ever felt the longing for someone you could admire? For something, not to look down at, but up to?"
"I've felt it all my life," she said.

When a man sees you are happy with him but you can be just as happy having nothing to do with him, thatâs when he wonât want to leave your side. When you are happy, you are sexy.

Until you change how you get things done, you'll never know what works best.

There is no greater insight into the future than recognizing...when we save our children, we save ourselves

This is who the fuck I am.

We think you'll find that every woman in her heart of hearts longs for three things: to be romanced, to play an irreplaceable role in a great adventure, and to unveil beauty. That's what makes a woman come alive.

You can't shake hands with a clenched fist.

And I remembered something else that makes us human: faith, the only weapon in our arsenal to battle doubt.

If there is anything that links the human to the divine, it is the courage to stand by a principle when everybody else rejects it.

This world is your best teacher. There is a lesson in everything. There is a lesson in each experience. Learn it and become wise. Every failure is a stepping stone to success. Every difficulty or disappointment is a trial of your faith. Every unpleasant incident or temptation is a test of your inner strength. Therefore nil desperandum. March forward hero!

Courtesy costs nothing, but buys everything.

Either you run the day or the day runs you..

Itâs never overreacting to ask for what you want and need.

That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind

It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.

...most of the time, all you have is the moment, and the imperfect love of the people around you.

I prefer you to make mistakes in kindness than work miracles in unkindness.

One of the lessons that I grew up with was to always stay true to yourself and never let what somebody else says distract you from your goals. And so when I hear about negative and false attacks, I really don't invest any energy in them, because I know who I am.

I am sure it is everyoneâs experience, as it has been mine, that any discovery we make about ourselves or the meaning of life is never, like a scientific discovery, a coming upon something entirely new and unsuspected; it is rather, the coming to conscious recognition of something, which we really knew all the time but, because we were unwilling to formulate it correctly, we did not hitherto know we knew.

Hope like that, as I thought before, doesnât make you a weak person. Itâs hopelessness that makes you weak. Hope makes you stronger, because it brings with it a sense of reason. Not a reason for how or why they were taken from you, but a reason for you to live. Because itâs a maybe. A âmaybe someday things wonât always be this shit.â And that âmaybeâ immediately makes the shittiness better.

I've learned one thing: you can only really get to know a person after a row. Only then can you judge their true character!

The difference between me and other people is that they all walk around with onion skins wrapped around them. Pre-meditations, pretentions, the faces that they present to the world, the faces that they present to themselves.. onion skins that come in layer after layer. They're on the inside of all that. And I... I am the inside of the onion skin walking around. I am only me.

Arrogance on the part of the meritorious is even more offensive to us than the arrogance of those without merit: for merit itself is offensive.

Go ahead and believe that no one shines brighter than you. Become amazing, and be happy.

Searching outside of you is Samsara (the world). Searching within you leads to Nirvana.

I believe in God, only I spell it Nature.

Rest is not idleness, and to lie sometimes on the grass under trees on a summer's day, listening to the murmur of the water, or watching the clouds float across the sky, is by no means a waste of time.

I know it is hard for you young mothers to believe that almost before you can turn around the children will be gone and you will be alone with your husband. You had better be sure you are developing the kind of love and friendship that will be delightful and enduring. Let the children learn from your attitude that he is important. Encourage him. Be kind. It is a rough world, and he, like everyone else, is fighting to survive. Be cheerful. Don't be a whiner.

Give me strength, not to be better than my enemies, but to defeat my greatest enemy, the doubts within myself. Give me strength for a straight back and clear eyes, so when life fades, as the setting sun, my spirit may come to you without shame.

It's not whether you got knocked down; it's whether you get back up.

Your beliefs affect your choices. Your choices shape your actions. Your actions determine your results. The future you create depends upon the choices you make and the actions you take today.

Things will get easier, people's minds will change, and you should be alive to see it.

Once your mindset changes, everything on the outside will change along with it.

You're not alone
Together we stand
I'll be by your side, you know I'll take your hand
When it gets cold
And it feels like the end
There's no place to go
You know I won't give in

I donât regret anything Iâve ever done in life, any choice that Iâve made. But Iâm consumed with regret for the things I didnât do, the choices I didnât make, the things I didnât say. We spend so much time being afraid of failure, afraid of rejection. But regret is the thing we should fear most. Failure is an answer. Rejection is an answer. Regret is an eternal question you will never have the answer to. âWhat ifâ¦â âIf onlyâ¦â âI wonder what would haveâ¦â You will never, never know, and it will haunt you for the rest of your days.

A sailor chooses the wind that takes the ship from a safe port. Ah, yes, but once you're abroad, as you have seen, winds have a mind of their own. Be careful, Charlotte, careful of the wind you choose.

Souls are like athletes, that need opponents worthy of them, if they are to be tried and extended and pushed to the full use of their powers, and rewarded according to their capacity.

Total paranoia is just total awareness.

I firmly believe that any man's finest hour, the greatest fulfillment of all that he holds dear, is that moment when he has worked his heart out in a good cause and lies exhausted on the field of battle - victorious." 

Sometimes the best of gods gift's arrive by the shattering of all the window panes.

Life is short. Kiss slowly, laugh insanely, love truly and forgive quickly

I AM THE MASTER OF MY FATE AND THE CAPTAIN OF MY DESTINY.

Leaders live by choice, not by accident.

I'm not going to die, I'm going home like a shooting star.

When we lose one we love, our bitterest tears are called forth by the memory of hours when we loved not enough.

Bebek berjalan berbondong-bondong, akan tetapi burung elang terbang sendirian.

Be yourself. Don't worry about what other people are thinking of you, because they're probably feeling the same kind of scared, horrible feelings that everyone does.

Books didnât make me wallow in darkness, darkness made me wallow in books.

If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.

Sanctify yourself and you will sanctify society.

Defeat is not the worst of failures. Not to have tried is the true failure.

Last night
the rain
spoke to me
slowly, saying, 
what joy
to come falling
out of the brisk cloud, 
to be happy again
in a new way
on the earth! 
Thatâs what it said
as it dropped, 
smelling of iron, 
and vanished
like a dream of the ocean
into the branches
and the grass below.
Then it was over.
The sky cleared.
I was standing
under a tree.
The tree was a tree
with happy leaves, 
and I was myself, 
and there were stars in the sky
that were also themselves
at the moment
at which moment
my right hand
was holding my left hand
which was holding the tree
which was filled with stars
and the soft rain â
imagine! imagine! 
the long and wondrous journeys
still to be ours.

Light is more important than the lantern,
The poem more important than the notebook

L'homme est libre au moment qu'il veut l'Ãªtre.

It has been my philosophy of life that difficulties vanish when faced boldly.

It is better for the heart to break, than not to break.

When one door closes another door opens; but we so often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door, that we do not see the ones which open for us.

When I left Queen's my future seemed to stretch out before me like a straight road. I thought I could see along it for many a milestone. Now there is a bend in it. I don't know what lies around the bend, but I'm going to believe that the best does.

In my deepest wound I saw your glory, and it dazzled me.

God will answer you prayers better than you think. Of course, one will not always get exactly what he has asked for....We all have sorrows and disappointments, but one must never forget that, if commended to God, they will issue in good....His own solution is far better than any we could conceive.

Dedicate yourself to what gives your life true meaning and purpose; make a positive difference in someone's life.

Consider non your superior, whatever their rank or station in life. Treat all fairly or they will seek revenge. Be careful with your money. Hold fast to your belief and others will listen." he continued at a slower pace, " of the affairs of love ... my only advice is to be honest. thats your most powerfull too to unlock a heart or gain forgiveness. that is all i have to say"Garrow to Roran p 64

She is delightfully chaotic; a beautiful mess. Loving her is a splendid adventure.

When you have a great and difficult task, something perhaps almost impossible, if you only work a little at a time, every day a little, suddenly the work will finish itself.

God, send me anywhere, only go with me. Lay any burden on me, only sustain me. And sever any tie in my heart except the tie that binds my heart to Yours.

The future doesn't belong to the light-hearted. It belongs to the brave.

Patience ensures victory.

If you are under the impression you have already perfected yourself, you will never rise to the heights you are no doubt capable of.

a dog is not considered a good dog because he is a good barker. a man is not considered a good man because he is a good talker.

... what you learn today, for no reason at all, will help you discover all the wonderful secrets of tomorrow.

Everything ends, and Everything matters. 
Everything matters not in spite of the end of you and all that you love, but because of it. Everything is all youâve gotâ¦and after Everything is nothing. So you were wise to welcome Everything, the good and the bad alike, and cling to it all. Gather it in. Seek the meaning in sorrow and donât ever turn away, not once, from here until the end. Because it is all the same, it is all unfathomable, and it is all infinitely preferable to the one dreadful alternative.

To be deeply loved, means a willingness to cut yourself wide open, exposing your vulnerabilities... hopes, hurts, fears and flaws. Hiding behind the highlight reel of who you are, is the real you and that person is just as worthy of love. There is nothing more terrifying or fulfilling, than complete love, it's worth the risk... reach for it.

Sometimes you just have to jump out the window and grow wings on the way down.

My love is something valuable to me which I ought not to throw away without reflection.

Everyones greatest fantasy is to walk away from the life (they think)you lead

When it rains it pours. Maybe the art of life is to convert tough times to great experiences: we can choose to hate the rain or dance in it.

I belive I can fly, I believe I can touch the sky. 

Stories are like genies...They can carry us into and though our sorrows. Sometimes they burn, sometimes they dance, sometimes they weep, sometimes they sing. Like genies, everyone has one. Like genies, sometimes we forget that we do.
Our stories can set us free...When we set them free.

Stop blaming outside circumstances for your inside chaos.

Hidup hanya ada erti pada yang bahagia.

Being defeated is often a temporary condition. Giving up is what makes it permanent.

You get in life what you have the courage to ask for.

You canât control what others think. The only thing you can control is yourself. Some people will look down on you for your choices in life, no matter what they are. You canât do anything about that. The only thing you can do is decide how to live your own life. And to hell with everybody else

There are moments in every relationship that define when two people start to fall in love.
A first glance
A first smile
A first kiss
A first fallâ¦
(I remove the Darth Vader house shoes from my satchel and look down at them.)
You were wearing these during one of those moments.
One of the moments I first started to fall in love with you.
The way you gave me butterflies that morning
Had absolutely nothing to do with anyone else,
and everything to do with you.
I was falling in love with you that morning
because of you.
(I take the next item out of the satchel. When I pull it out and look up, she brings her hands to her mouth in shock.)
This ugly little gnome
With his smug little grinâ¦
He's the reason I had an excuse to invite you into my house.
Into my life.
You took a lot of aggression out on him over those next few months.
I would watch from my window as you would kick him over every time you walked by him.
Poor little guy.
You were so tenacious.
That feisty, aggressive, strong-willed side of youâ¦.
The side of you that refused to take crap from this concrete gnome?
The side of you that refused to take crap from me?
I fell in love with that side of you
because of you.
(I set the gnome down on the stage and grab the CD)
This is your favorite CD
âLaykenâs shit.â
Although now I know you intended for shit to be possessive, rather than descriptive.
The banjo started playing through the speakers of your car
and I immediately recognized my favorite band.
Then when I realized it was your favorite band, too?
The fact that these same lyrics inspired both of us?
I fell in love with that about you.
That had absolutely nothing to do with anyone else.
I fell in love with that about you
because of you.
(I take a slip of paper out of the satchel and hold it up. When I look at her, I see Eddie slide her a napkin. I canât tell from up here, but that can only mean sheâs crying.)
This is a receipt I kept.
Only because the item I purchased that night was on the verge of ridiculous.
Chocolate milk on the rocks? Who orders that?
You were different, and you didnât care.
You were being you.
A piece of me fell in love with you at that moment,
because of you.
This? (I hold up another sheet of paper.)
This I didnât really like so much.
Itâs the poem you wrote about me.
The one you titled 'mean?'
I donât think I ever told youâ¦
but you made a zero.
And then I kept it
to remind myself of all the things I never want to be to you.
(I pull her shirt from my bag. When I hold it into the light, I sigh into the microphone.)
This is that ugly shirt you wear.
It doesnât really have anything to do with why I fell in love with you.
I just saw it at your house and thought Iâd steal it.

No lake so still but it has its wave.
No circle so perfect but that it has its blur.
I would change things for you if I could; As I can't you must take them as they are.

Nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could do only a little.

I used to have a sign pinned up on my wall that read: Only to the extent that we expose ourselves over and over to annihilation can that which is indestructible be found in us...It was all about letting go of everything.

My name is Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered.

Accept yourself, your strengths, your weaknesses, your truths, and know what tools you have to fulfill your purpose.

We pencil-sketch our previous life so we can contrast it to the technicolor of the moment. 

A tiny change today brings a dramatically different tomorrow.

Unhappy memories are persistent. They're specific, and it's the details that refuse to leave us alone. Though a happy memory may stay with you just as long as one that makes you miserable, what you remember softens over time. What you recall is simply that you were happy, not necessarily the individual moments that brought about your joy.
But the memory of something painful does just the opposite. It retains its original shape, all bony fingers and pointy elbows. Every time it returns, you get a quick poke in the eye or jab in the stomach. The memory of being unhappy has the power to hurt us long after the fact. We feel the injury anew each and every time we think of it.

No name-calling truly bites deep unless, in some dark part of us, we believe it. If we are confident enough then it is just noise.

She could hear, some way off, her brothers calling to each other in the woods behind the house. She hoped desperately that their game wouldn't bring them any closer, that they wouldn't scare the birds away.
 Somehow she knew that you didn't get many moments like this in your life: moments when you knew, without any doubt, that you were alive, when you felt the air in your lungs and the wet grass beneath your feet and the cotton on your skin; moments when you were completely in the present, when neither the past nor the future mattered.
 She tried to slow her breathing, hoping somehow to make this moment last forever.

Maybe it just means that love can be stronger than fear.

Wake up, Shake up, Make up and Break up; life is all about moving like ant in search of sugar not sand.

I'd rather die while I'm living than live while I'm dead. 


. I am not speaking, of course, of the beauty which strikes the senses, of the beauty of qualities and appearances. I am far from despising this, but it has nothing to do with science. What I mean is that more intimate beauty which comes from the harmonious order of its parts, and which a pure intelligence can grasp.

Out, out brief candle, life is but a walking shadow...a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.

When you get up in the morning, you have two choices - either to be happy or to be unhappy. Just choose to be happy

I want to be justice, love and the wrath of God all in one.

Only when we give joyfully, without hesitation or thought of gain, can we truly know what love means.

Have to? Of course you have to! But only because of you, Harry, won't rest until Voldemort is finished! Think now, for once, if you have never heard of the prophecy! What would you do?

Do your work, then step back. The only path to serenity.

Now don't you understand man universal law
What you throw out comes back to you, star
Never underestimate those who you scar
Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard

Nalaman kong habang lumalaki ka, maraming beses kang madadapa. Bumangon ka man ulit o hindi, magpapatuloy ang buhay, iikot ang mundo, at mauubos ang oras.

Muchos aÃ±os despuÃ©s, frente al pelotÃ³n de fusilamiento, el coronel Aureliano BuendÃ­a habÃ­a de recordar aquella tarde remota en que su padre lo llevÃ³ a conocer el hielo. Macondo era entonces una aldea de 20 casas de barro y caÃ±abrava construidas a la orilla de un rÃ­o de aguas diÃ¡fanas que se precipitaban por un lecho de piedras pulidas, blancas y enormes como huevos prehistÃ³ricos. El mundo era tan reciente, que muchas cosas carecÃ­an de nombre, y para mencionarlas habÃ­a que seÃ±alarlas con el dedo".

Buy a pup and your money will buy
Love unflinching that cannot lie.

It's better to have a few faithful friends than numerous shallow friendships.

If you are her man, she will talk to you until there just
arenât any more words left to say, encourage you when youâre
at rock bottom and think there just isnât any way out, hold you
in her arms when youâre sick, and laugh with you when youâre
up. And if youâre her man and that woman loves youâI mean
really loves you?âshe will shine you up when youâre dusty,
encourage you when youâre down, defend you even when sheâs
not so sure you were right, and hang on your every word, even
when youâre not saying anything worth listening to.

Tragedy and adversary are the stones we sharpen our swords against so we can fight new battles.

The night before brain surgery, I thought about death. I searched out my larger values, and I asked myself, if I was going to die, did I want to do it fighting and clawing or in peaceful surrender? What sort of character did I hope to show? Was I content with myself and what I had done with my life so far? I decided that I was essentially a good person, although I could have been better--but at the same time I understood that the cancer didn't care.
I asked myself what I believed. I had never prayed a lot. I hoped hard, I wished hard, but I didn't pray. I had developed a certain distrust of organized religion growing up, but I felt I had the capacity to be a spiritual person, and to hold some fervent beliefs. Quite simply, I believed I had a responsibility to be a good person, and that meant fair, honest, hardworking, and honorable. If I did that, if I was good to my family, true to my friends, if I gave back to my community or to some cause, if I wasn't a liar, a cheat, or a thief, then I believed that should be enough. At the end of the day, if there was indeed some Body or presence standing there to judge me, I hoped I would be judged on whether I had lived a true life, not on whether I believed in a certain book, or whether I'd been baptized. If there was indeed a God at the end of my days, I hoped he didn't say, 'But you were never a Christian, so you're going the other way from heaven.' If so, I was going to reply, 'You know what? You're right. Fine.'
I believed, too, in the doctors and the medicine and the surgeries--I believed in that. I believed in them. A person like Dr. Einhorn [his oncologist], that's someone to believe in, I thought, a person with the mind to develop an experimental treatment 20 years ago that now could save my life. I believed in the hard currency of his intelligence and his research.
Beyond that, I had no idea where to draw the line between spiritual belief and science. But I knew this much: I believed in belief, for its own shining sake. To believe in the face of utter hopelessness, every article of evidence to the contrary, to ignore apparent catastrophe--what other choice was there? We do it every day, I realized. We are so much stronger than we imagine, and belief is one of the most valiant and long-lived human characteristics. To believe, when all along we humans know that nothing can cure the briefness of this life, that there is no remedy for our basic mortality, that is a form of bravery.
To continue believing in yourself, believing in the doctors, believing in the treatment, believing in whatever I chose to believe in, that was the most important thing, I decided. It had to be.
Without belief, we would be left with nothing but an overwhelming doom, every single day. And it will beat you. I didn't fully see, until the cancer, how we fight every day against the creeping negatives of the world, how we struggle daily against the slow lapping of cynicism. Dispiritedness and disappointment, these were the real perils of life, not some sudden illness or cataclysmic millennium doomsday. I knew now why people fear cancer: because it is a slow and inevitable death, it is the very definition of cynicism and loss of spirit.
So, I believed.

I change the world, the world changes me.

Secangkir kopi yang dengan tenang menunggu kau minum itu tidak pernah mengusut kenapa kau bisa membedakan aromanya dari asap yang setiap hari kau hirup ketika berangkat dan pulang kerja di kota yang semakin tidak bisa mengerti kenapa mesti ada secangkir kopi yang tersedia di atas meja setiap pagi

Never apologize for burning too brightly or collapsing into yourself every night. That is how galaxies are made.

Make voyages. Attempt them. There's nothing else.

Jesus said several times, âCome, follow me.â His was a program of âdo what I do,â rather than âdo what I say.â His innate brilliance would have permitted him to put on a dazzling display, but that would have left his followers far behind. He walked and worked with those he was to serve. His was not a long-distance leadership. He was not afraid of close friendships; he was not afraid that proximity to him would disappoint his followers. The leaven of true leadership cannot lift others unless we are with and serve those to be led.

There are many people who can do big things, but there are very few people who will do the small things.

My sun sets to rise again.

Love has no limitations. It cannot be measured. It has no boundaries. Although many have tried, love is indefinable.

Pressure makes diamonds

We're miserable because we think that we are mere individuals, alone with our fears and flaws and resentment and mortality.

Stop giving your life away to other people.

Everything that had happened was shockingly beautiful, enough to make you crazy.

This is not the end, this is not even the beginning of the end, this is just perhaps the end of the beginning.

The More we value things, the less we value ourselves

God made the world round so we would never be able to see too far down the road.

The greatest thing about dreams is they donât expire. They can lay dormant for years and when you pull them out and dust them off, they shine like new.

Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better take things as they come along with patience and equanimity.

Only one life, âtwill soon be past,
Only whatâs done for Christ will last.

Your mother won a special reward," she told me, "because everyone had a head in her pictures. We all applauded.

Don't count your owls before they are delivered.

A wise man always has something to say, whereas a fool always needs to say something.

The pressures on gay teens can be overwhelming--to keep secrets, tell lies, deny who you are, and try to be who you're not. Remember: you are special and worth being cared about, loved, and accepted just as you are. Never, ever let anyone convince you otherwise.

just because you fail once, it doesn't mean you're going to fail at everything. keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself because if you don't, then who will? so keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.

Failing sucks. But it's better than the alternative."
"Which is?"
"Not even trying." Now he did look at me, straight on. "Life's short, you know?

Beware of speaking too much, for it increases mistakes and engenders boredom.

If I have the belief that I can do it, I shall surely acquire the capacity to do it even if I may not have it at the beginning.

She was broken from moment to moment, watching her world collide she felt lost inside herself. She fell apart for a passion that flamed beneath her. She waited and died a hundred times, it dripped from her pores. The moment she let go, she soared over the stillness like the star she was born to be.

Inspiration comes of working every day.

In the end, you feel that your much-vaunted, inexhaustible fantasy is growing tired, debilitated, exhausted, because you're bound to grow out of your old ideals; they're smashed to splinters and turn to dust, and if you have no other life, you have no choice but to keep rebuilding your dreams from the splinters and dust. But the heart longs for something different! And it is vain to dig in the ashes of your old fancies, trying to find even a tiny spark to fan into a new flame that will warm the chilled heart and bring back to life everything that can send the blood rushing wildly through the body, fill the eyes with tears--everything that can delude you so well!

A woman can't do anything about her appearance. Either she's pretty or she isn't. But her character is quite another matter.

Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.

Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen.

Whether you know or not, you are the infinite potential of love, peace and joy

Beannacht / Blessing
On the day when
the weight deadens
on your shoulders
and you stumble,
may the clay dance
to balance you.
And when your eyes
freeze behind
the grey window
and the ghost of loss
gets in to you,
may a flock of colours,
indigo, red, green,
and azure blue
come to awaken in you
a meadow of delight.
When the canvas frays
in the currach of thought
and a stain of ocean
blackens beneath you,
may there come across the waters
a path of yellow moonlight
to bring you safely home.
May the nourishment of the earth be yours,
may the clarity of light be yours,
may the fluency of the ocean be yours,
may the protection of the ancestors be yours.
And so may a slow
wind work these words
of love around you,
an invisible cloak
to mind your life.

Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.


[T]he race is long - to finish first, first you must finish.

We are what we are, neither a good or as bad as others paint us. And what we are doesn't change how truly we feel, only how free we are to follow those feelings.

Idealisme adalah kemewahan terakhir yang hanya dimiliki oleh pemuda.

If you feel far from God, guess who moved?

A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed at some indefinite time in the future.

Each man should frame life so that at some future hour fact and his dreaming meet.

I wanted change and excitement and to shoot off in all directions myself, like the colored arrows from a Fourth of July rocket.

Therefore I would ask you to write all kinds of books, hesitating at no subject however trivial or however vast. By hook or by crook, I hope that you will possess yourselves of money enough to travel and to idle, to contemplate the future or the past of the world, to dream over books and loiter at street corners and let the line of thought dip deep into the stream.

Do not try to explain feelings. Live everything intensely and treasure what you feel as a gift from God.

You were born together, and together you shall be for evermore...But let there be spaces in your togetherness...Love one another, but make not a bond of love. Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls. Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup. Give one another of your bread but eat not of the same loaf. Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.

It is books that are a key to the wide world; if you can't do anything else, read all that you can.

There is no illusion greater than fear.

Hope springs forever.

The moment you become miserly you are closed to the basic phenomenon of life: expansion, sharing. The moment you start clinging to things, you have missed the target--you have missed. Because things are not the target, you, your innermost being, is the target--not a beautiful house, but a beautiful you; not much money, but a rich you; not many things, but an open being, available to millions of things.

Don't get set into one form, adapt it and build your own, and let it grow, be like water.

Simplify your life. You don't grow spiritual, you shrink spiritual.

I have a dream.â âIs your dream very big?â âNo.â âWell is it very grand?â âNot either.â âNeither?â âNeither.â âWhat is it then?â âIt is very shiny.

I think there is a song out there to describe just about any situation.

A great tree develops over time and can tell stories not only those of happiness, but also those that contain pain from what it has seen over the years, and as a result is the wise ancient tree that it is today. As the seasons change, the tree naturally goes through changes as well: where the leaves turn yellow and orange in the fall, falling by the Winter, returning in the Spring, and with full set of new leafs by the Summer. Love is no different in that there will be times when we are fully naked in the Winter, and left to wonder about Spring when it seemed so easy to love, yet the wise tree knows that no winter will last forever no matter how cold it may be.

It was never about the world being too big, it was more like she was too much for the world to handle.

For your past, for your flaws, and ultimately for your stress; I judge no one whom Iâve met along the way because in a sense we were all wounded in our own ways.

The first thing you have to know about writing is that it is something you must do everyday. There are two reasons for this rule: Getting the work done and connecting with your unconscious mind.

As I naturally go through a full range of emotions in my life, I mustnât feel ashamed for feeling lost, for it is honest and human to feel such.

And...I think that's what life is all about, actually,
about children and flowers.

One day in my shoes and a day for me in your shoes, the beauty of travel lies in the ease and willingness to be more open.

Some we proudly display on our arms, while others we shyly conceal. Tattoo the moments of sorrow as well as the moments of splendor and beauty. Tattoo in an acknowledgment and tribute to home, and tattooing your beliefs that define who you are. Whether we intended to or not, every moment of our lives are tattooed to our heart.

Beauty is the only human aspect which cannot be captured on any canvas howsoever hard an artist tries. At the most, the undaunted artist can replicate the beauty on paper but what is a replica in comparison to the original! The humbling resemblance can only be respected, not truly adored. 
Beauty cannot be imprisoned in the lens of a camera. The images of beauty are a moment of its essence. Beauty cannot be displayed to evoke pleasure for all on a cinema screen. Those are just its imprints, mere illusions of its existence. Beauty cannot be described by words; it cannot be written or read about. There are no suitable words in all the languages of the world, ancient or modern to hold it between a paper and a pen or a script and an eye. Beauty can only be experienced from far, its delightful aroma can only be tasted through oneâs eyes and its pleasurable sight can only be felt from the soul.
Beauty can only be best described at its origin through a befuddling silence, the kind that leaves one almost on the verge of a pleasurable death, just because one chooses beauty over life. There is nothing in this world to hold something so pure, so divine except a loving heart. And it is the only manner through which love recognises love; the language of love has no alphabet, no words.

The life given us, by nature is short; but the memory of a well-spent life is eternal.

You don't have to make something that people call art. Living is an artistic activity, there is an art to getting through the day.

The ground's generosity takes in our compost and grows beauty! Try to be more like the ground.

Whoever you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want something, it's because that desire originated in the soul of the universe. It's your mission on earth.

A daydreamer is prepared for most things.

Every beginning has an end and every end is a new beginning.

At times our own light goes out and is rekindled by a spark from another person. Each of us has cause to think with deep gratitude of those who have lighted the flame within us.

It is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our lives that we must draw our strength to live and our reasons for living.

I am larger, better than I thought; I did not know I held so much goodness.
All seems beautiful to me.
Whoever denies me, it shall not trouble me;	
Whoever accepts me, he or she shall be blessed, and shall bless me.

My young sisters, we have such hope for you. We have such great expectations for you. Don't settle for less than what the Lord wants you to be...
Give me a young woman who loves home and family, who reads and ponders the scriptures daily, who has a burning testimony of the Book of Mormon... Give me a young woman who is virtuous and who has maintained her personal purity, who will not settle for less than a temple marriage, and I will give you a young woman who will perform miracles for the Lord now and throughout eternity.

Stop comparing yourself to others. Always strive to improve yourself to become better today than you were yesterday to serve those around you and the world.

You don't win races by wishing, you win them by running faster than everyone else does.

Dreams are shores where the ocean of spirit meets the land of matter. Dreams are beaches where the yet-to-be, the once-were, the will-never-be may walk awhile with the still are.

I wanted to become the seeker, the aroused and passionate explorer, and it was better to go at it knowing nothing at all, always choosing the unmarked bottle, always choosing your own unproven method, armed with nothing but faith and a belief in astonishment.

Well, if it can be thought, it can be done, a problem can be overcome,

Perhaps life is just that... a dream and a fear

Study, along the lines which the theologies have mapped, will never lead us to discovery of the fundamental facts of our existence. That goal must be attained by means of exact science and can only be achieved by such means. The fact that man, for ages, has superstitiously believed in what he calls a God does not prove at all that his theory has been right. There have been many gods â all makeshifts, born of inability to fathom the deep fundamental truth. There must be something at the bottom of existence, and man, in ignorance, being unable to discover what it is through reason, because his reason has been so imperfect, undeveloped, has used, instead, imagination, and created figments, of one kind or another, which, according to the country he was born in, the suggestions of his environment, satisfied him for the time being. Not one of all the gods of all the various theologies has ever really been proved. We accept no ordinary scientific fact without the final proof; why should we, then, be satisfied in this most mighty of all matters, with a mere theory?
Destruction of false theories will not decrease the sum of human happiness in future, any more than it has in the past... The days of miracles have passed. I do not believe, of course, that there was ever any day of actual miracles. I cannot understand that there were ever any miracles at all. My guide must be my reason, and at thought of miracles my reason is rebellious. Personally, I do not believe that Christ laid claim to doing miracles, or asserted that he had miraculous power...
Our intelligence is the aggregate intelligence of the cells which make us up. There is no soul, distinct from mind, and what we speak of as the mind is just the aggregate intelligence of cells. It is fallacious to declare that we have souls apart from animal intelligence, apart from brains. It is the brain that keeps us going. There is nothing beyond that.
Life goes on endlessly, but no more in human beings than in other animals, or, for that matter, than in vegetables. Life, collectively, must be immortal, human beings, individually, cannot be, as I see it, for they are not the individuals â they are mere aggregates of cells.
There is no supernatural. We are continually learning new things. There are powers within us which have not yet been developed and they will develop. We shall learn things of ourselves, which will be full of wonders, but none of them will be beyond the natural.

Only children believe they're capable of everything.

In the final analysis it is between you and God, it was never between you and them anyway.

at your weakest, you end up showing more strength; at your lowest, you are suddenly lifted higher than youâve ever been. They all border one another, these opposites and show how quickly we can be altered.

Music, my rampart and my only one.

Cake is happiness! If you know the way of the cake, you know the way of happiness! If you have a cake in front of you, you should not look any further for joy!

Every single desire can lead to dream and every single dream has possibility to become reality.

We're constantly being told what other people think we are, and that's why it is so important to know yourself.

I am buoyant and expansive and uncontainable--but I always was so, only I never knew it!

What you do matters â but not much. What you 
 matters tremendously.

When we make our own misery we sometimes cling to it even when we want so bad to change, because misery is something we know. The misery is comfortable.

Love is not a relationship, love is a state of being; it has nothing to do with anybody else. One is not "in love", one is love. And of course when one is love, one is in love â but that is an outcome, a by-product, that is not the source. The source is that one is love.

Most of us lead far more meaningful lives than we know. Often finding meaning is not about doing things differently; it is about seeing familiar things in new ways. 

We become so absorbed in our flaws and faults that we forget that it is better to be a diamond with a flaw than a pebble without. To have flaws is beauty in itself, a fact so frightening that we hurry to hide them from sight and tarnish the whole in the process of comparing ourselves to others.

Anxiety is the handmaiden of creativity

If you don't have time to do it right, when will you have the time to do it over?

Be ruthless about protecting writing days, i.e., do not cave in to endless requests to have "essential" and "long overdue" meetings on those days. The funny thing is that, although writing has been my actual job for several years now, I still seem to have to fight for time in which to do it. Some people do not seem to grasp that I still have to sit down in peace and write the books, apparently believing that they pop up like mushrooms without my connivance. I must therefore guard the time allotted to writing as a Hungarian Horntail guards its firstborn egg.

A bird is safe in its nest - but that is not what its wings are made for.

It is said that God has created man in his own image. But it may be that humankind has created God in the image of humankind.

Life is one fool thing after another whereas love is two fool things after each other.

When the world pushes you to your knees, you're in the perfect position to pray

Criticism - however valid or intellectually engaging - tends to get in the way of a writer who has anything personal to say. A tightrope walker may require practice, but if he starts a theory of equilibrium he will lose grace (and probably fall off).

Do you not then hear this horrible scream all around you that people usually call silence.

While we may judge things as good or bad, karma doesn't. It's a simple case of like gets like, the ultimate balancing act, nothing more, nothing less. And if you're deteremined to fix every situation you deem as bad, or difficult, or somehow unsavory, then you rob the person of their own chance to fix it, learn from it, or even grow from it. Some things, no matter how painful, happen for a reason. A reason you or I may not be able to grasp at first sight, not without knowing a person's entire life storyâtheir cumulative past. And to just barge in and interfere, no matter how well-intentioned, would be akin to robbing them of their journey. Something that's better not done.

What if she's all I give you in this life of ours, my love?" she asked quietly. 
"Then I'll shout at the goddess in fury," he said fiercely. "I'll beg to know why I've been given so much when other men have so little.

No matter how much falls on us, we keep plowing ahead. That's the only way to keep the roads clear.

No matter how many people believe or donât believe in you, you must be
the ultimate believer in yourself!

I held my heart back from positively accepting anything, since I was afraid of another fall, and in this condition of suspense I was being all the more killed.

I feel very adventurous. There are so many doors to be opened, and I'm not afraid to look behind them.

Youâre not a human being until you value something more than the life of your body. And the greater the thing you live and die for the greater you are.

Exuberance is beauty.

The world is your exercise book, the pages on which you do your sums. It is not reality, though you may express reality there if you wish. You are also free to write lies, or nonsense, or to tear the pages.

Patience is a virtue, but there comes a moment when you must stop being patient and take the day by the throat and shake it. If it fights back; fine. I'd rather end up bloody at the end of the day, then unhurt with no progress made, no knowledge gained. I'd rather have a no, then nothing. I'd forgotten that about myself.

Were these boys in their right minds? Here were two boys with good intellect, one eighteen and one nineteen. They had all the prospects that life could hold out for any of the young; one a graduate of Chicago and another of Ann Arbor; one who had passed his examination for the Harvard Law School and was about to take a trip in Europe,--another who had passed at Ann Arbor, the youngest in his class, with three thousand dollars in the bank. Boys who never knew what it was to want a dollar; boys who could reach any position that was to boys of that kind to reach; boys of distinguished and honorable families, families of wealth and position, with all the world before them. And they gave it all up for nothing, for nothing! They took a little companion of one of them, on a crowded street, and killed him, for nothing, and sacrificed everything that could be of value in human life upon the crazy scheme of a couple of immature lads.
Now, your Honor, you have been a boy; I have been a boy. And we have known other boys. The best way to understand somebody else is to put yourself in his place.
Is it within the realm of your imagination that a boy who was right, with all the prospects of life before him, who could choose what he wanted, without the slightest reason in the world would lure a young companion to his death, and take his place in the shadow of the gallows?
...No one who has the process of reasoning could doubt that a boy who would do that is not right.
How insane they are I care not, whether medically or legally. They did not reason; they could not reason; they committed the most foolish, most unprovoked, most purposeless, most causeless act that any two boys ever committed, and they put themselves where the rope is dangling above their heads....
Why did they kill little Bobby Franks?
Not for money, not for spite; not for hate. They killed him as they might kill a spider or a fly, for the experience. They killed him because they were made that way. Because somewhere in the infinite processes that go to the making up of the boy or the man something slipped, and those unfortunate lads sit here hated, despised, outcasts, with the community shouting for their blood.
. . . I know, Your Honor, that every atom of life in all this universe is bound up together. I know that a pebble cannot be thrown into the ocean without disturbing every drop of water in the sea. I know that every life is inextricably mixed and woven with every other life. I know that every influence, conscious and unconscious, acts and reacts on every living organism, and that no one can fix the blame. I know that all life is a series of infinite chances, which sometimes result one way and sometimes another. I have not the infinite wisdom that can fathom it, neither has any other human brain

In life, you need either inspiration or desperation.

Every search begins with beginnerâs luck. And every search ends with the victorâs being severely tested.

Is life too short to be taking this shit, or is life too short to be minding it?

Harry, despite your privileged insight into Voldemortâs world (which, incidentally, is a gift any Death Eater would kill to have), you have never been seduced by the Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the slightest desire to become one of Voldemortâs followers!â
âOf course I havenât!â said Harry indignantly. âHe killed my mum and dad!â
âYou are protected, in short, by your ability to love!â said Dumbledore loudly.

We may run, walk, stumble. drive, or fly, but let us never lose sight of the reason for the journey, or miss a chance to see a rainbow on the way.

People in general would rather die than forgive. It's

Time to toss the dice

Itâs funny how one summer can change everything. It must be something about the heat and the smell of chlorine, fresh-cut grass and honeysuckle, asphalt sizzling after late-day thunderstorms, the steam rising while everything drips around it. Something about long, lazy days and whirring air conditioners and bright plastic flip-flops from the drugstore thwacking down the street. Something about fall being so close, another year, another Christmas, another beginning. So much in one summer, stirring up like the storms that crest at the end of each day, blowing out all the heat and dirt to leave everything gasping and cool. Everyone can reach back to one summer and lay a finger to it, finding the exact point when everything changed. That summer was mine.

kenangan itu cuma hantu di sudut pikir. selama kita diam dan ngga berbuat apa-apa, selamanya dia tetap jadi hantu, ngga akan pernah jadi kenyataan.

Because sometimes there are problems bigger than this weekâs end of the world and sometimes you just have to find the extraordinary in your ordinary life.

I no longer agree to treat myself with disrespect. Every time a self-critical thought comes to mind, I will forgive the Judge and follow this comment with words of praise, self-acceptance, and love.

To exist in this vast universe for a speck of time is the great gift of life. Our tiny sliver of time is our gift of life. It is our only life. The universe will go on, indifferent to our brief existence, but while we are here we touch not just part of that vastness, but also the lives around us. Life is the gift each of us has been given. Each life is our own and no one else's. It is precious beyond all counting. It is the greatest value we can have. Cherish it for what it truly is..... Your life is yours alone. Rise up and live it.

Making others happy, through kindness of speech and sincerity of right advice, is a sign of true greatness. To hurt another soul by sarcastic words, looks, or suggestions, is despicable.

You look at yourself and you accept yourself for who you are, and once you accept yourself for who you are you become a better person.

I will take the Ring", he said, "though I do not know the way.

Freedom is not having everything we crave, it's being able to go without the things we crave and being OK with it. 

Focus on making choices to lead your life that aligns with your core values in the most purposeful way possible.

But as the years went on, I realised that what I really want to be, all told, is a human. Just a productive, honest, courteously treated human.

Do not act as if you had ten thousand years to throw away. Death stands at your elbow. Be good for something while you live and it is in your power.

On Wednesday, when the sky is blue,
and I have nothing else to do,
I sometimes wonder if it's true 
That who is what and what is who."
 - Winnie-the-Pooh

Regret is counterproductive. It's looking back on a past that you can't change. Questioning things as they occur can prevent regret in the future.

Fear is how you lose your life...a little bit at a time...What we give to fear, we take away from...faith.

I challenge every one of you who can hear me to rise to the divinity within you. Do we really realize what it means to be a child of God, to have within us something of the divine nature?

Republicans are for both the man and the dollar, but in case of conflict the man before the dollar.

The best of a book is not the thought which it contains, but the thought which it suggests; just as the charm of music dwells not in the tones but in the echoes of our hearts.

I would rather have 30 minutes of "wonderful" than a lifetime of nothing special.

Each of us is an innkeeper who decides if there is room for Jesus!

Until we see each other again, keep your head together, read some good books, be useful, be happy.

Don't let the tall weeds cast a shadow on the beautiful flowers in your garden.

Live your life, no matter what that life is.

The past is a place of learning, not a place of living.

Of all the idiots I have met in my life, and the Lord knows they have not been few or little, I think that I have been the biggest.

The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Watch your step.

You make mistakes, mistakes don't make you

Doing nothing for others is the undoing of ourselves.

Find a purpose to serve, not a lifestyle to live.

Never let fear hold you captive. 
Never let self-doubt hold you captive. 
Never let frustration hold you captive.

Great goals make great people. People cannot hit what they do not aim for.

Goals are the road maps that guide you to your destination. 
Cultivate the habit of setting clearly-defined written goals; they are the road maps that guide you to your destination.

What's unnatural is homophobia. Homo sapiens is the only species in all of nature that responds with hate to homosexuality.

We cannot change what we are not aware of, and once we are aware, we cannot help but change.

Tomorrow is a new day; begin it well and serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense.

Decide in your heart of hearts what really excites and challenges you, and start moving your life in that direction. Every decision you make, from what you eat to what you do with your time tonight, turns you into who you are tomorrow, and the day after that. Look at who you want to be, and start sculpting yourself into that person. You may not get exactly where you thought you'd be, but you will be doing things that suit you in a profession you believe in. Don't let life randomly kick you into the adult you don't want to become.

To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow.

If freedom is short of weapons, we must compensate with willpower.

I admire those who do good and expect nothing in return.

The sun shall always rise upon a new day and there shall always be a rose garden within me. Yes, there is a part of me that is broken, but my broken soil gives way to my wild roses.

Saya akan pikul rahsia itu jika engkau percayakan kepada saya dan saya akan masukkan ke dalam perbendaharaan hati saya dan kemudian saya kunci pintunya erat-erat. Kunci itu akan saya lemparkan jauh-jauh sehingga seorang pun tak dapat mengambilnya kedalam lagi.

Kalau lawan bicaramu mendengar dengan sepenuh hati, beban pikiranmu menjadi ringan. Kalau kamu tambah ruwet, meski yang mendengarkanmu tadi seolah serius mendengar, berarti dia tidak benar-benar hadir untukmu.

Too many locks, not enough keys.

With an eye made quiet by the power of harmony, and the deep power of joy, we see into the life of things.

These mountains that you are carrying, you were only supposed to climb.

Iâve been doing this a long time, and Iâve come to learn that predictions donât mean much. Too much lies outside the realm of medical knowledge. A lot of what happens next comes down to you and your specific genetics, your attitude. No, thereâs nothing we can do to stop the inevitable, but thatâs not the point. The point is that you should try to make the most of the time you have left.

For a long while I have believed â this is perhaps my version of Sir Darius Xerxes Camaâs belief in a fourth function of outsideness â that in every generation there are a few souls, call them lucky or cursed, who are simply born not belonging, who come into the world semi-detached, if you like, without strong affiliation to family or location or nation or race; that there may even be millions, billions of such souls, as many non-belongers as belongers, perhaps; that, in sum, the phenomenon may be as ânaturalâ a manifestation of human nature as its opposite, but one that has been mostly frustrated, throughout human history, by lack of opportunity. 
And not only by that: for those who value stability, who fear transience, uncertainly, change, have erected a powerful system of stigmas and taboos against rootlessness, that disruptive, anti-social force, so that we mostly conform, we pretend to be motivated by loyalties and solidarities we do not really feel, we hide our secret identities beneath the false skins of those identities which bear the belongersâ seal of approval. 
But the truth leaks out in our dreams; alone in our beds (because we are all alone at night, even if we do not sleep by ourselves), we soar, we fly, we flee. And in the waking dreams our societies permit, in our myths, our arts, our songs, we celebrate the non-belongers, the different ones, the outlaws, the freaks.
What we forbid ourselves we pay good money to watch, in a playhouse or a movie theater, or to read about between the secret covers of a book. Our libraries, our palaces of entertainment tell the truth. The tramp, the assassin, the rebel, the thief, the mutant, the outcast, the delinquent, the devil, the sinner, the traveler, the gangster, the runner, the mask: if we did not recognize in them our least-fulfilled needs, we would not invent them over and over again, in every place, in every language, in every time.

Happiness is not having what you want, it is wanting what you have.

you cannot find happiness, outside the plan of happiness!

Survivors can't always choose their methods.

Have you realized that most of your unhappiness in life is due to the fact that you are listening to yourself instead of talking to yourself? Take those thoughts that come to you the moment you wake up in the morning. You have not originated them but they are talking to you, they bring back the problems of yesterday, etc. Somebody is talking. Who is talking to you? Your self is talking to you. Now this manâs treatment [in Psalm 42] was this: instead of allowing this self to talk to him, he starts talking to himself. âWhy art thou cast down, O my soul?â he asks. His soul had been depressing him, crushing him. So he stands up and says, âSelf, listen for moment, I will speak to you.

See? See what you can do? Never mind you canât tell one letter from another, never mind you born a slave, never mind you lose your name, never mind your daddy dead, never mind nothing. Here, this here, is what a man can do if he puts his mind to it and his back in it. Stop sniveling,â [the land] said. âStop picking around the edges of the world. Take advantage, and if you canât take advantage, take disadvantage. We live here. On this planet, in this nation, in this county right here. Nowhere else! We got a home in this rock, donât you see! Nobody starving in my home; nobody crying in my home, and if I got a home you got one too! Grab it. Grab this land! Take it, hold it, my brothers, make it, my brothers, shake it, squeeze it, turn it, twist it, beat it, kick it, kiss it, whip it, stomp it, dig it, plow it, seed it, reap it, rent it, buy it, sell it, own it, build it, multiply it, and pass it on â can you hear me? Pass it on!

I went to the school and put it to William, particularly, that if you find someone you love in life, you must hang onto it, and look after it, and if you were lucky enough to find someone who loved you, then you must protect it.

He who defends with love will be secure; Heaven will save him, and protect him with love.

I believe that life is a prize, but to live doesn't mean you're alive.

I am striving to give back the Divine in myself to the Divine in the All.

You couldn't erase the past. You couldn't even change it. But sometimes life offered you the opportunity to put it right.

Who we are in the present includes who we were in the past.

We all have negative thoughts now and then, but we can choose not to dwell there and not to let them control us.

If one makes a mistake, then an apology is usually sufficient to get things back on an even keel. However-and this is a big âhoweverâ- most people do not ever know why their apology did not seem to have any effect. It is simply that they did not make a mistake; they made a choiceâ¦and never understood the difference between the two.

Public opinion is a weak tyrant compared with our own private opinion. what a man thinks of himself, that it is which determines, or rather indicates, his fate.

Warriors of light always have a certain gleam in their eyes.
They are of this world, they are part of the lives of others, and they set out on their journey with no saddlebags and no sandals. They are often cowardly. They do not always make the right decisions.
They suffer over the most trivial things, they have mean thoughts, and sometimes believe that they are incapable of growing. They frequently deem themselves unworthy of any blessing or miracle.
They are not always quite sure what they are doing here. They spend many sleepless nights, believing that their lives have no meaning.
That is why they are warriors of light. Because they make mistakes. Because they ask themselves questions. Because they are looking for a reason - and are sure to find it.

Arise, awake, stop not till the goal is reached.

It is when you lose sight of yourself, that you lose your way. To keep your truth in sight you must keep yourself in sight and the world to you should be a mirror to reflect to you your image; the world should be a mirror that you reflect upon.

Dead, we are revealed in our true dimensions, and they are surprisingly modest.

The creatures that inhabit this earth--be they human beings or animals--are here to contribute, each in its own particular way, to the beauty and prosperity of the world.

Man is, that he may have Joy.

Always Remember to take your Vitamins: Take your Vitamin A for ACTION, Vitamin B for Belief, Vitamin C for Confidence ,Vitamin D for Discipline, Vitamin E for Enthusiasm!!

When you become the image of your own imagination, it's the most powerful thing you could ever do.

In imagination she sailed over storied seas that wash the distant shining shores of "faÃ«ry lands forlorn," where lost Atlantis and Elysium lie, with the evening star for pilot, to the land of Heart's Desire. And she was richer in those dreams than in realities; for things seen pass away, but the things that are unseen are eternal.

Better to illuminate than merely to shine to deliver to others contemplated truths than merely to contemplate.

Blessed are the weird people: 
poets, misfits, writers
mystics, painters, troubadours
for they teach us to see the world through different eyes.

I'm an adventurer, looking for treasure

Tough times never last. Tough people do

And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.

The important thing is not the object of love, but the emotion itself.

The personal life deeply lived always expands into truths beyond itself.

There will always be people who say it does not exist because they cannot have it. But I tell you it is true and that you have it and that you are lucky even if you die tomorrow.

If we were to one day encounter a form of life more powerful and intelligent than our own, and it regarded us as we regard fish, what would be our argument against being eaten?

Better not to give in to it. It takes ten times as long to put yourself back together as it does to fall apart.

When you expect nothing from the world - not the light of the sun, the wet of water, nor the air to breathe - everything is a wonder and every moment a gift.

I've never quite believed that one chance is all I get

Change isn't easy. Changing the way you live means changing the way you think, means changing what you believe about life. That's hard.

To accomplish great things, we must not only act but also dream, not only plan, but also believe!

We must pass through the darkness, to reach the light.

Enjoyment appears at the boundary between boredom and anxiety, when the challenges are just balanced with the person's capacity to act.

Mutual caring relationships require kindness and patience, tolerance, optimism, joy in the other's achievements, confidence in oneself, and the ability to give without undue thought of gain.

Do not let another day go by where your dedication to other people's opinions is greater than your dedication to your own emotions!

People are successful because they think and act like successful people.

The difference between false memories and true ones is the
same as for jewels: it is always the false ones that look the
most real, the most brilliant.

To get what you want, you have to know exactly how much you are willing to give up.

Humans have come into being for the sake of each other, so either teach them, or learn to bear them.

Great spirits have always encountered opposition from mediocre minds. The mediocre mind is incapable of understanding the man who refuses to bow blindly to conventional prejudices and chooses instead to express his opinions courageously and honestly.

But as I have noticed on more than one occaision, life itself is unfair, and there is no complaint department, so we might as well accept things the way they happen, clean up the mess, and move on.

Anyone who is steady in his determination for the advanced stage of spiritual realization and can equally tolerate the onslaughts of distress and happiness is certainly a person eligible for liberation.

Nothing like a nighttime stroll to give you ideas.

I have never felt that anything really mattered but knowing that you stood for the things in which you believed and had done the very best you could.

A brother is like gold and a friend is like diamond. If gold cracks you can melt it and make it just like it was before. If a diamond cracks, it can never be like it was before.

Everytime I plant a seed,he say kill it before it grow, he say kill it before they grow.

We all know we're going to die; what's important is the kind of men and women we are in the face of this.

When a good man is hurt, all who would be called good must suffer with him.

Pack a pillow and blanket and see as much of the world as you can.You will not regret it.

Dreams are the language of God.

It is foolish to tear oneâs hair in grief, as though sorrow would be made less by baldness.

No other success can compensate for failure in the home.

Abandon the urge to simplify everything, to look for formulas and easy answers, and to begin to think multidimensionally, to glory in the mystery and paradoxes of life, not to be dismayed by the multitude of causes and consequences that are inherent in each experience -- to appreciate the fact that life is complex.

Sometimes God makes better choices for us than we could have ever made for ourselves.

take what you can from your dreams
Make them real as anything
It takes the work out of the courage

For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but of power and of love and of calm and well balanced mind and discipline and self-control.

Our great human adventure is the evolution of consciousness. We are in this life to enlarge the soul, liberate the spirit, and light up the brain.

I ended my first book with the words 'no answer.' I know now, Lord, why you utter no answer. You are yourself the answer. Before your face questions die away. What other answer would suffice? Only words, words; to be led out to battle against other words.

I think being a teenager is such a compelling time period in your life--it gives you some of your worst scars and some of your most exhilarating moments. It's a fascinating place; old enough to feel truly adult, old enough to make decisions that affect the rest of your life, old enough to fall in love, yet, at the same time too young (in most cases) to be free to make a lot of those decisions without someone else's approval.

Once time is lit, it will burn whether or not you're breathing it in. Even after smoke becomes air, there is the memory of smoke. I am seeing as if by the light of a match, a glimpse of my life and having it feel right.

It always helps to think about other people instead of ourselves.

The moral of the story is even though that seemed like the end of the world back then, right now I can look back on it and laugh. And if anyone is going through something similar right now just know it will get better.

Go boldly and honestly through the world. Learn to love the fact that there is nobody else quite like you.

I used to think the world was broken down by tribes,' I said. 'By Black and White. By Indian and White. But I know this isn't true. The world is only broken into two tribes: the people who are assholes and the people who are not.

I consider myself a stained-glass window. And this is how I live my life. Closing no doors and covering no windows; I am the multi-colored glass with light filtering through me, in many different shades. Allowing light to shed and fall into many many hues. My job is not to direct anything, but only to filter into many colors. My answer is destiny and my guide is joy. And there you have me.

To make real friends you have to put yourself out there. Sometimes people will let you down, but you can't let that stop you. If you get hurt, you just pick yourself up, dust off your feelings, and try again.

Education is experience, and the essence of experience is self-reliance.

Christ is not valued at all, unless he is valued above all.

Real love never fails.

Great acts are made up of small deeds.

Life is no brief candle to me. It is a sort of splendid torch which I have got a hold of for the moment, and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations.

Life is 10 percent what happens to you and ninety percent how you respond to it.

Approval is overrated...Approval and disapproval alike satisfy those who deliver it more than those who receive it. I don't care for approval, and I don't mind doing without.

Painful as it may be, a significant emotional event can be the catalyst for choosing a direction that serves us - and those around us - more effectively. Look for the learning.

Dancing in all its forms cannot be excluded from the curriculum of all noble education; dancing with the feet, with ideas, with words, and, need I add that one must also be able to dance with the pen?

In spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at heart. I simply can't build up my hopes on a foundation consisting of confusion, misery and death.

As you walk through forests
or the meadows of your mind,
Stop and talk to those you fear
Good friendships you may find

What affects one in a major way, affects all in a minor way.

Happiness has to do with your mindset, not with outside circumstance.

Never say 'I can't.' 'I can't' is a limit, and life is about breaking through limits. Say 'I will' instead.

Everyone has a hidden agenda. Except me!

To put meaning in one's life may end in madness,
But life without meaning is the torture
Of restlessness and vague desire--
It is a boat longing for the sea and yet afraid.

Every day God invites us on the same kind of adventure. It's not a trip where He sends us a rigid itinerary, He simply invites us. God asks what it is He's made us to love, what it is that captures our attention, what feeds that deep indescribable need of our souls to experience the richness of the world He made. And then, leaning over us, He whispers, "Let's go do that together.

What is she to you anyway?"
"Here's my answer captain. She's the thing that made this all okay-the threadbare coats and the old boots and the guns that jams when you most need them to fire, the loneliness of knowing that you don't matter, that you will never matter, the fact that you're just another body, another uniform to be sent into the fold or the frost, another good boy who knows his place, who does his job, who doesn't ask questions, who will lie down and die and be forgotten. What is she? She's everything, you dumb son of a bitch.

If I were given the opportunity to present a gift to the next generation, it would be the ability for each individual to learn to laugh at himself.

God's extraordinary work is most often done by ordinary people in the seeming obscurity of a home and family.

A sense of calm came over me. More and more often I found myself thinking, "This is where I belong. This is what I came into this world to do.

The universe is a million billion light-years wide, and every inch of it would kill you if you went there. This is the position of the universe with regards to human life.

I want you to go back into the barrack and tell the men to come out after the storm. Tell them to look up at me tied here. Tell them Iâll open my eyes and look back at them, and theyâll know hat I survived.

Her burdens were her own and burdens were for shoulders strong enough to bear them.

It is necessary to hope... for hope itself is happiness.

In order to know who you are you need to know God is.

Revenge is not sweet; it is gloomy and a waste of time.

Love me or hate me, i swear it won't make or break me.

Although time seems to fly, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest. In each waking day, you will find scores of blessings and opportunities for positive change. Do not let your TODAY be stolen by the unchangeable past or the indefinite future! Today is a new day!

There isn't time, so brief is life, for bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account. There is only time for loving, and but an instant, so to speak, for that.

Your greatest self has been waiting your whole life; don't make it wait any longer.

Some people come into our lives and quickly go. Some people move our souls to dance. They awaken us to a new understanding with the passing whisper of their wisdom. Some people make the sky more beautiful to gaze upon. They stay in our lives for awhile, leave footprints on our hearts, and we are never, ever the same.

You are doing God's work. You are doing it wonderfully well. He is blessing you, and He will bless you, --even--no, -especially--when your days and your nights may be most challenging. Like the woman who anonymously, meekly, perhaps even with hesitation and some embarrassment, fought her way through the crowd just to touch the hem of the Master's garment, so Christ will say to the women who worry and wonder and weep over their responsibility as mothers, `Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole.' And it will make your children whole as well.

You would have made a fine warrior, you know that?"
I am one. Death is my enemy."
Yeah, it is, isn't it." God, it made such sense that he'd bonded with her. She was a fighterâ¦ like him. "Your scalpel's your dagger."
Yup.

No matter how safe and beautiful it is, a cage is still a cage.

My atheism, like that of 
, is true piety towards the universe and denies only gods fashioned by men in their own image, to be servants of their human interests.

just remember: i love you, and love yourselves. 'cause, little monsters, you were born that way baby.

Work is a blessing. God has so arranged the world that work is necessary, and He gives us hands and strength to do it. The enjoyment of leisure would be nothing if we had only leisure. It is the joy of work well done that enables us to enjoy rest, just as it is the experiences of hunger and thirst that make food and drink such pleasures.

That's what you want to do? Then nothing beats a trial but a failure. Give it everything you've got. I've told you many times, 'Cant do is like Dont Care.' Neither of them have a home.

You must draw from that strength. You must increase it. And you must hold on to it because sometimes that small glimmer of inner strength is all that we have to help us press forward through the darkness.

You can't hang around waiting for somebody else to pull your strings. Destiny's what you make of it. You have to face whatever life throws at you. And if it throws more than you'd like, more than you think you can handle? Well then you just have to find the heroism within yourself and play out the hand you've been dealt. The universe never sets a challenge that can't be met. You just need to believe in yourself in order to find the strength to face it.

Too many people spend too much time trying to perfect something before they actually do it. Instead of waiting for perfection, run with what you go, and fix it along the wayâ¦

We Greeks believe that a man who takes no part in public affairs is not merely lazy, but good for nothing

There are few sources of energy so powerful as a procrastinating college student.

Bunkum and tummyrot! You'll never get anywhere if you go about what-iffing like that. Would Columbus have discovered America if he'd said 'What if I sink on the way over? What if I meet pirates? What if I never come back?' He wouldn't even have started.

And to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.

The moment you stop worrying about success is when success will happen.

The truth was this: Love is a decision.

The warrior is Here, Now.

Trust men and they will be true to you; treat them greatly and they will show themselves great.

Wise men put their trust in ideas and not in circumstances.

If you are a writer you locate yourself behind a wall of silence and no matter what you are doing, driving a car or walking or doing housework you can still be writing, because you have that space.

As I go clowning my sentimental way into eternity, wrestling with all my problems of estrangement and communion, sincerity and simulation, ambition and acquiescence, I shuttle between worrying whether I matter at all and whether anything else matters but me.

I learned a lot from the stories my uncle, aunts and grandparents told me: that no one is perfect but most people are good; that people canât be judged by their worst or weakest moments; that harsh judgements can make hypocrites of us all; that a lot of life is just showing up and hanging on; that laughter is often the best, and sometimes the only response to pain.
Perhaps most important, I learned that everyone has a story â of dreams and nightmares, hope and heartache, love and loss, courage and fear, sacrifice and selfishness. All my life Iâve been interested in other peopleâs stories. I wanted to know them, understand them, feel them. When I grew up into politics, I always felt the main point of my work was to people a chance to have better stories. - Page 15, Paragraph 5, âMy Lifeâ by Bill Clinton. âHard cover version-

Nothing is so much calculated to lead people to forsake sin as to take them by the hand and to watch over them in tenderness. When persons manifest the least kindness and love to me, O what pow'r it has over my mind.

â"What does it mean if i'm afraid? Does it mean something bad is going to happen?" "No, it doesn't mean something bad is going to happen. It just means that you have the chance to be brave.

We often think of peace as the absence of war, that if powerful countries would reduce their weapon arsenals, we could have peace. But if we look deeply into the weapons, we see our own minds- our own prejudices, fears and ignorance. Even if we transport all the bombs to the moon, the roots of war and the roots of bombs are still there, in our hearts and minds, and sooner or later we will make new bombs. To work for peace is to uproot war from ourselves and from the hearts of men and women. To prepare for war, to give millions of men and women the opportunity to practice killing day and night in their hearts, is to plant millions of seeds of violence, anger, frustration, and fear that will be passed on for generations to come. 

Do not pray for easy lives. Pray to be stronger men.


Struggling and suffering are the essence of a life worth living. If you're not pushing yourself beyond the comfort zone, if you're not demanding more from yourself - expanding and learning as you go - you're choosing a numb existence. You're denying yourself an extraordinary trip.

We carry about us the burden of what thousands of people have said and the memories of all our misfortunes. To abandon all that is to be alone, and the mind that is alone is not only innocent but young -- not in time or age, but young, innocent, alive at whatever age -- and only such a mind can see that which is truth and that which is not measurable by words.

Dear Human:
You've got it all wrong.
You didn't come here to master unconditional love. This is where you came from and where you'll return.
You came here to learn personal love.
Universal love.
Messy love.
Sweaty Love.
Crazy love.
Broken love.
Whole love.
Infused with divinity.
Lived through the grace of stumbling.
Demonstrated through the beauty of... messing up.
Often.
You didn't come here to be perfect, you already are.
You came here to be gorgeously human. Flawed and fabulous.
And rising again into remembering.
But unconditional love? Stop telling that story.
Love in truth doesn't need any adjectives.
It doesn't require modifiers.
It doesn't require the condition of perfection.
It only asks you to show up.
And do your best.
That you stay present and feel fully.
That you shine and fly and laugh and cry and hurt and heal and fall and get back up and play and work and live and die as YOU.
Its enough.
It's Plenty.

We all have same beginning (BIRTH), and we will have same ending (DEATH). So how different can we be?

[Fireheart]mewed,"It's not my place to judge you." Greystripe looked up as Fireheart went on." Greystripe, whatever you decide to do, I will always be your friend.

You will make all kinds of mistakes; but as long as you are generous and true and also fierce you cannot hurt the world or even seriously distress her. She was meant to be wooed and won by youth.

Every individual has a place to fill in the world and is important in some respect, whether he chooses to be so or not.

Now, five years is nothing in a man's life except when he is very young and very old...
- Wang Lung

You are stronger than you know.

You become mature when you become the authority of your own life.

Bukan mudah untuk berubah... dari tanpa arah ke sejadah, dari tepi jalanan ke sujud menghadap Tuhan.

When you're good at something, you'll tell everyone. When you're great at something, they'll tell you.

Be creative, be useful, be practical, be generous and finish big

He who jumps into the void owes no explanation to those who stand and watch.

I have something that I call my Golden Rule. It goes something like this: 'Do unto others twenty-five percent better than you expect them to do unto you.' â¦ The twenty-five percent is for error.

Champions are made from something they have deep inside of them-a desire, a dream, a vison.

It is better to fill your head with useless knowledge than no knowledge at all.

It's daring to be curious about the unknown, to dream big dreams, to live outside prescribed boxes, to take risks, and above all, daring to investigate the way we live until we discover the deepest treasured purpose of why we are here.

When you grow up as a girl, the world tells you the things that you are supposed to be: emotional, loving, beautiful, wanted. And then when you are those things, the world tells you they are inferior: illogical, weak, vain, empty.

It seems that a profound, impartial, and absolutely just opinion of our fellow-creatures is utterly unknown. Either we are men, or we are women. Either we are cold, or we are sentimental. Either we are young, or growing old. In any case life is but a procession of shadows, and God knows why it is that we embrace them so eagerly, and see them depart with such anguish, being shadows. And why, if this -- and much more than this is true -- why are we yet surprised in the window corner by a sudden vision that the young man in the chair is of all things in the world the most real, the most solid, the best known to us--why indeed? For the moment after we know nothing about him.
Such is the manner of our seeing. Such the conditions of our love.

Read books. Care about things. Get excited. Try not to be too down on youself. Enjoy the ever present game of knowing.

Forget about self-image and self-judgment. It's about self-love, and no one teaches you that at school. No one teaches you that if you accept and love yourself, nothing and no one can touch you. 
This is the only face and body you're ever going to get, so be comfortable and happy in it. Own it. Own every aspect of who you are and present it to the world with the utmost pride.

A book series is never truly over. The story lives on, even when the final page has been turned.

Plus thereâs the fact,â he went on, making it clear he didnât need me to reply anyway, âthat music is a total constant. Thatâs why we have such a strong visceral connection to it, you know? Because a song can take you back instantly to a moment, or a place, or even a person. No matter what else has changed in you or the world, that one song stays the same, just like that moment. Which is pretty amazing, when you actually think about it.

When one flower blooms spring awakens everywhere

No one invites you to the top - you have to claw your way up. When you get there, you will sit with the others who were also uninvited - giggling. 

And life is what we make it.
Always has been, always will be.

A beautiful thing happens when we start paying attention to each other. It is by participating more in your relationship that you breathe life into it.

I was halfway across America, at the dividing line between the East of my youth and the West of my future.

Differences are not intended to separate, to alienate. We are different precisely in order to realize our need of one another.

Berputar menjadi sesuatu yang bukan kita, demi bisa menjadi diri kita lagi.

In the name of the best within you, do not sacrifice this world to those who are at its worst. In the name of the values that keep you alive, do not let your vision of people be distorted by the ugly, the cowardly, the mindless in those who have never achieved integrity. Do not lose your knowledge that our proper estate is an upright posture,
an intransigent mind and a step that travels unlimited roads. Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps of the approximate, the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely frustration for the life you deserved, but have never been able to reach. Check your road and the nature of your battle. The world you desired can be won, it exists, it is real, it's yours.

Man made God in his own image...

Push yourself to do more and to experience more. Harness your energy to start expanding your dreams. Yes, expand your dreams. Don't accept a life of mediocrity when you hold such infinite potential within the fortress of your mind. Dare to tap into your greatness.

Be compassionate ... and take responsibility for each other. If we only learned those lessons, this world would be a better place.

A woman could be as beautiful as she felt herself to be.

The trouble with fiction," said John Rivers, "is that it makes too much sense. Reality never makes sense.

Words are tears that have been written down. Tears are words that need to be shed. Without them, joy loses all its brilliance and sadness has no end.

Too many people realize at the end of their lives that they've taken for granted those who really love them. 

Rich People plan for three generations
Poor people plan for Saturday night

Let them call me a rebel and welcome. I feel no concern from it. But should I suffer the misery of devils, were I to make a whore of my soul.

Somehow difficulties are easier to endure when you know your dream is waiting for you at the end.

People need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want.

Do more listening than talking; talk more about them than about you.

Sometimes you've got to be able to listen to yourself and be okay with no one else understanding.

If you don't feel as close to God today as you did yesterday, who moved?

Given a choice between life and death, choose life. Given a choice between right and wrong, choose what's right. And given a choice between a terrible truth and a beautiful lie, choose the truth every time.

It is wisdom to recognize necessity when all other courses have been weighed, though as folly it may appear to those who cling to false hope.

I shrug, trapped. I donât want to lose him. In spite of all his demands, his need to control, his scary vices. I have never felt as alive as I do now. Itâs a thrill to be sitting here beside him. Heâs so unpredictable, sexy, smart, and funny. But his
moodsâ¦ oh â and he wants to hurt me. He says heâll think about my reservations, but it still scares me. I close my eyes. What can I say? Deep down I would just like more, more affection, more playful Christian, moreâ¦ love.

I donât ever remember being afraid of âoldnessâ.
There are things I miss about being younger - chiefly the ability to pull all-nighters and keep working and working well; and being smiled at by girls I didnât know who thought I was cute; and I wish I had the eyesight I had even five years agoâ¦ but that stuff feels pretty trivial. 
Iâm happier than Iâve been at any time in my life these days. I have a wonderful wife whom I adore, watched three amazing kids grow into two delightful adults and my favourite teenager, an astonishing number of grand life experiences, Iâve made art Iâm proud of, I have real, true, glorious friends, and Iâve been able to do real good for things I care about, like freedom of speech, like libraries.
Sometimes Iâll do something like An Evening With Neil and Amanda, or the 8 in 8 project, and completely surprise myself.
I miss friends who have died, but then, Iâm glad that time gave them to me, to befriend, even for a while, and that I was alive to know them. I knew Douglas Adams, and I knew Roger Zelazny, and I knew John M Ford, and I knew Diana Wynne Jonesâ¦ do you know how lucky that makes me?
Ah, Iâm rabbiting on, and I sound a bit more Pollyannaish than Iâm intending to sound: I know the downside of age and the downside of time, and I am sure that the view from age 51 is not the view from age 71.
I wish the time hadnât gone so fast, though. And sometimes I wish Iâd enjoyed it more on the way, and worried about it less.

Courage comes from a heart that is CONVINCED it is loved.

The paths to liberation are numerous, but the bank along the way is always the same, the Bank of Karma, where the liberation account of each of us is credited or debited depending on our actions.

Kaladin screamed, reaching the end of the bridge. Finding a tiny surge of strength somewhere, he raised his spear and threw himself off the end of the wooden platform, launching into the air above the cavernous void.
	Bridgemen cried out in dismay. Syl zipped about him with worry. Parshendi looked up with amazement as a lone bridgeman sailed through the air toward them.
	His drained, worn-out body barely had any strength left. In that moment of crystallized time, he looked down on his enemies. Parshendi with their marbled red and black skin. Soldiers raising finely crafted weapons, as if to cut him from the sky. Strangers, oddities in carapace breastplates and skullcaps. Many of them wearing beards.
	Beards woven with glowing gemstones.
	Kaladin breathed in.
	Like the power of salvation itselfâlike rays of sunlight from the eyes of the AlmightyâStormlight exploded from those gemstones. It streamed through the air, pulled in visible streams, like glowing columns of luminescent smoke. Twisting and turning and spiraling like tiny funnel clouds until they slammed into him.
	And the storm came to life again.

Just because you refuse to acknowledge something, refuse to look at it or think about it, doesnât mean itâs not there, that it doesnât affect you and the choices you make in your life.

And if you think you're alone. Put on my music. Because I'm going to be there for you.

Dupa ce iti omori demonii, daca ai curajul sa o faci, e musai sa te intorci pe acelasi drum.

Youâre not a bad person, youâre just a little bit different and Iâm a sucker for that.

She's a woman, you're a dude. You're not 
 to understand her. That's 
 what she's after.... She doesn't want you to understand 
. She knows 
 impossible. She just wants you to understand 
. Everything else is negotiable.

I know. Itâs all wrong. By rights we shouldnât even be here. But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, itâs only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didnât. They kept going, because they were holding on to something.

You shouldn't judge someone until you've walk a mile through an underground tunnel in her uncomfortable shoes

When those you love die, the best you can do is honor their spirit for as long as you live. You make a commitment that you're going to take whatever lesson that person or animal was trying to teach you, and you make it true in your own life... it's a positive way to keep their spirit alive in the world, by keeping it alive in yourself.

Confidence is like a dragon where, for every head cut off, two more heads grow back.

Many people say I'm the best women's soccer player in the world. I don't think so. And because of that, someday I just might be.

She might be pointing to a doorway, or a person, or the sky. But such things were so common to my eyes, so undistinguished, that they would register as "nothing" I walked in a gray world of nothing.

America is too great for small dreams.

Though my work may be menial, though my contribution may be small, I can perform it with dignity and offer it with unselfishness. My talents may not be great, but I can use them to bless the lives of others.... The goodness of the world in which we live is the accumulated goodness of many small and seemingly inconsequential acts.

Temptation is not to be feared, but controlled.

If you canât believe in miracles, then believe in yourself. When you want something bad enough, let that drive push you to make it happen. Sometimes youâll run into brick walls that are put there to test you. Find a way around them and stay focused on your dream. Where thereâs a will, thereâs a way.

With time and perspective we recognize that such problems in life do come for a purpose, if only to allow the one who faces such despair to be convinced that he really does need divine strength beyond himself, that she really does need the offer of heavenâs hand. Those who feel no need for mercy usually never seek it and almost never bestow it. Those who have never had a heartache or a weakness or felt lonely or forsaken never have had to cry unto heaven for relief of such personal pain. Surely it is better to find the goodness of God and the grace of Christ, even at the price of despair, than to risk living our lives in a moral or material complacency that has never felt any need for faith or forgiveness, any need for redemption or relief.

People don't believe what you tell them.
They rarely believe what you show them.
They often believe what their friends tell them.
They always believe what they tell themselves.

Hurl yourself at goals above your head and bear the lacerations that come when you slip and make a fool of yourself. Try always, as long as you have breath in your body, to take the hard wayâand work, work, work to build yourself into a rich, continually evolving entity.

Never let yourself be persuaded that any one Great Man, any one leader, is necessary to the salvation of America. When America consists of one leader and 158 million followers, it will no longer be America.

One must work and dare if one really wants to live.

All paths are the same: they lead nowhere. ... Does this path have a heart? If it does, the path is good; if it doesn't, it is of no use. Both paths lead nowhere; but one has a heart, the other doesn't. One makes for a joyful journey; as long as you follow it, you are one with it. The other will make you curse your life. One makes you strong; the other weakens you.

By reading the scriptures I am so renewed that all nature seems renewed around me and with me. The sky seems to be a pure, a cooler blue, the trees a deeper green. The whole world is charged with the glory of God and I feel fire and music under my feet. 

life's kind of like a painting. A really bizarre, abstract painting. You could look at it and think that all it is, is a blur. And you could continue living your life thinking that all it is, is just a blur. But if you really look at it, really see it, focus on it, and use your imagination, life can become so much more. The painting could be of the sea, the sky, people,buildings, a butterfly on a flower, or anything except the blur you were once convinced it was.

I have a self-made quote: Celebrate diversity, practice acceptance and may we all choose peaceful options to conflict.

With a hint of good judgment, to fear nothing, not failure or suffering or even death, indicates that you value life the most. You live to the extreme; you push limits; you spend your time building legacies. Those do not die.

Today, many will choose to live free of conditions and rules governing their own happiness. Why not you? Do not let another day go by where your dedication to other people's opinions is greater than your dedication to your own emotions! Today's a new day!

The wolves knew when it was time to stop looking for what they'd lost, to focus instead on what was yet to come.

Convictions are prisons.

But she loves me. Me. Just the way I am.

Enjoy every ounce of your life, get high and be sincere to anybody that comes around you.

Jesus has now many lovers of the heavenly kingdom but few bearers of His cross.

Maybe love was meant to save us from ourselves.

Concentration attracts luck factor.

All shall be done, but it may be harder than you think.

It's up to you today to start making healthy choices. Not choices that are just healthy for your body, but healthy for your mind.

A respectable appearance is sufficient to make people more interested in your soul

Instead of complaining about the problem and blaming others, start finding the solution.

We may have all come on different ships, but we're in the same boat now.

The two of you, there's something uncanny about the way you two are with each other. I mean everything--the way you look at each other, the way she relaxes when you put your hand on her back, the way you both seem to know what the other is always thinking, it's always struck me as extraordinary. That's another reason I keep putting marriage off. I know I want something like what you two share, and I'm not sure I've found it yet. I'm not sure I ever will. And with love like that, they say anything's possible, right?

People aren't born good or bad. Maybe they're born with tendencies either way, but it's the way you live your life that matters. And the people you know. Valentine was Hodge's friend, and I don't think Hodge really had anyone else in his life to challenge him or make him be a better person. If I'd had that life, I don't know how I would have turned out. But I didn't. I have my family. And I have you.

I liked things better when I didn't understand them.

Sometimes you can learn, even from a bad experience. By coping you become stronger. The pain does not go away, but it becomes manageable.

It is impossible to be both selfish and happy

If you want to be a writer, you have to write every day... You don't go to a well once but daily. You don't skip a child's breakfast or forget to wake up in the morning...

Men take care not to make women weep, for God counts their tears.

Respect for self is the beginning of cultivating virtue in men and women.

Allow yourself to enjoy each happy moment in your life.

And then, despite everything, I smiled and looked at the note and knew that spring would come âit always does. so I stared out that cold window, watching my breath collect on the glass, trying not to think about my life after the thaw.

Speak when you are angry, and you'll make the best speech you'll ever regret.

Stop searching the world for treasure, the real treasure is in yourself.

It's what you learn after you know it all that counts.

So much for endings. Beginnings are always more fun. True connoisseurs, however, are known to favor the stretch in between, since it's the hardest to do anything with. That's about all that can be said for plots, which anyway are just one thing after another, a what and a what and a what.

You will see that the things you desire most are the very things that bring you the greatest sorrow.

Regardless of Sunshine or Rain, Be Thankful for another GREAT dayâ¦and treat Life as the ULTIMATE Gift.... Because IT IS :)

Be patient. Your skin took a while to deteriorate. Give it some time to reflect a calmer inner state. As one of my friends states on his Facebook profile: "The true Losers in Life, are not those who Try and Fail, but those who Fail to Try.

If you can control your behavior when everything around you is out of control, you can model for your children a valuable lesson in patience and understanding...and snatch an opportunity to shape character.

A real scientist solves problems, not wails that they are unsolvable.

It is possible for the human spirit to win after all.

Guilt starts as a feeling of failure.

The power to change your life lies in the simplest of steps.

Fear is a natural emotion in life, but you cannot let it dictate your actions. When you act out of fear, you will only meet failure. But act out of determination to conquer that fear, and you will succeed at anything. Maybe not the first time, or the second or third, but eventuallyâas long as you keep tryingâyou can conquer your fears and succeed.

I donât need any plastic in my body to validate me as a woman.

Some of us go full circle. Some of us blindly go nowhere. The circle doesnât have to be very large to make a point, kick your ass and/or be entertaining. Remember that and stay light. Even the deaf know good music when they hear it.

It was the moment I realized what music can do to people, how it can make you hurt and feel so good all at once.

Be happy with who you are and what you do, and you can do anything you want.

Listen to what you know instead of what you fear.

Do the kind of things that come from the heart, When you do, you won't be dissatisfied, you won't be envious, you won't be longing for somebody else's things. On the contrary, you'll be overhelmed with what comes back

When you lost sight of your path, listen for the destination in your heart (Allen Walker, D-gray Man)

Never compromise your values.

Live life as though nobody is watching, and express yourself as though everyone is listening.

One of the best guides to how to be self-loving is to give ourselves the love we are often dreaming about receiving from others. There was a time when I felt lousy about my over-forty body, saw myself as too fat, too this, or too that. Yet I fantasized about finding a lover who would give me the gift of being loved as I am. It is silly, isn't it, that I would dream of someone else offering to me the acceptance and affirmation I was withholding from myself. This was a moment when the maxim "You can never love anybody if you are unable to love yourself" made clear sense. And I add, "Do not expect to receive the love from someone else you do not give yourself.

When I begin to doubt my ability to work the word, I simply read another writer and know I have nothing to worry about. My contest is only with myself, to do it right, with power, and force, and delight, and gamble.

I will not die an unlived life.
I will not live in fear
of falling or catching fire.
I choose to inhabit my days,
to allow my living to open me,
to make me less afraid,
more accessible;
to loosen my heart
until it becomes a wing, 
a torch, a promise.
I choose to risk my significance,
to live so that which came to me as seed
goes to the next as blossom,
and that which came to me as blossom,
goes on as fruit.

I have met some highly intelligent believers, but history has no record to say that [s]he knew or understood the mind of god. Yet this is precisely the qualification which the godly must claimâso modestly and so humblyâto possess. It is time to withdraw our 'respect' from such fantastic claims, all of them aimed at the exertion of power over other humans in the real and material world.

Don't bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.

The night is just a part of the day

Read. Read 1000 pages for every 1 page that you write.

We can never know what might have been but what is to come is another matter entirely

The purpose of life is to discover your gift. The meaning of life is to give your gift away.

For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these times as in times of old as in times to come; wherefore, the course of the Lord is one eternal round" - 1 Nephi 10:19

Buy or borrow self-improvement books, but don't read them. Stack them around your bedroom and use them as places to rest bowls of cookies.
Watch exercise shows on television, but don't do the exercises. Practice believing that the benefit lies in imagining yourself doing the exercises.
Don't power walk. Saunter slowly in the sun, eating chocolate, and carry a blanket so you can take a nap.

You're water. We're the millstone.
You're wind. We're dust blown up into shapes.
You're spirit. We're the opening and closing 
of our hands. You're the clarity.
We're the language that tries to say it.
You're joy. We're all the different kinds of laughing.

I am overwhelmed by the grace and persistence of my people.

The best way to prepare for death is to live life to its fullest. 

Advice to friends. Advice to fellow mothers in the same boat. "How do you do it all?" Crack a joke. Make it seem easy. Make everything seem easy. Make life seem easy and parenthood and marriage and freelancing for pennies, writing a novel and smiling after a rejection, keeping the faith after two, reminding oneself that four years of work counted for a lot, counted for everything. Make the bed. Make it nice. Make the people laugh when you sit down to write and if you can't make them laugh make them cry. Make them want to hug you or hold you or punch you in the face. Make them want to kill you or fuck you or be your friend. Make them change. Make them happy. Make the baby smile. Make him laugh. Make him dinner. Make him proud.
Hold the phone, someone is on the other line. She says its important. People are dying. Children. Friends. Press mute because there is nothing you can say. Press off because you're running out of minutes. Running out of time. Soon he'll be grown up and you'll regret the time you spent pushing him away for one more paragraph in the manuscript no one will ever read. Put down the book, the computer, the ideas. Remember who you are now. Wait. Remember who you were. Wait. Remember what's important. Make a list. Ten things, no twenty. Twenty thousand things you want to do before you die but what if tomorrow never comes? No one will remember. No one will know. No one will laugh or cry or make the bed. No one will have a clue which songs to sing to the baby. No one will be there for the children. No one will finish the first draft of the novel. No one will publish the one that's been finished for months. No one will remember the thought you had last night, that great idea you forgot to write down.

True love is boundless like the ocean and, swelling within one, spreads itself out and, crossing all boundaries and frontiers, envelops the whole world.

Be yourself. Don't worry about what other people are thinking of you.

The most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love, and to let it come in.
2.	Forgive yourself before you die. Then forgive others.
3.	Death ends a life, not a relationship.
4.	Once you learn how to die, you learn how to live.
5.	Sometimes you cannot believe what you see, you have to believe what you feel. And if you are ever going to have other people trust you, you must feel that you can trust them too-even when you are in the dark. Even when you're falling.
6.	As you grow old, you learn more. If you stayed at twenty-two, you'd always be as ignorant as you were at twenty-two. Aging is not just decay, you know. It's growth. It's more than the negative that you're going to die, its also the positive that you understand you're going to die, and that you live a better life because of it.

How aware are we of our own inner life, our spirituality-something so intangible yet so priceless? How much effort do we make to perceive that which is not obvious, which can neither be seen nor heard? I believe the exploration and enrichment of the human spirit is what determines our very humanity. Such enrichment provides an inner compass that can lead civilizations to greatness.

That which we persist in doing becomes easier to do, not that the nature of the thing has changed, but our power to do so is increased.

Attitude is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, than education, money, circumstances, than failures and success, than what other people think, say, or do. It is more important than appearance, ability, or skill. It will make or break a business, a home, a friendship, an organization. The remarkable thing is I have a choice every day of what my attitude will be. I cannot change my past. I cannot change the actions of others. I cannot change the inevitable. The only thing I can change is attitude. Life is ten percent what happens to me and ninety percent how I react to it.

Sometimes change was good. Sometimes it was even exactly what you needed.

No one is to blame because there is no one other than you. Nothing is to disrespect because there is nothing other than you.

If a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door.

If you want the best the world has to offer, offer the world your best.

The question is not how to get cured, but how to live.

I want you to learn the lesson of the lotus. This flower springs forth from muddy waters. It raises its delicate petals to the sun and perfumes the world while, at the same time, its roots cling to the elemental muck, the very essence of the mortal experience. Without that soil, the flower would wither and die.

Don't give in to fear. Be strong, like i know you are. An never give up, d'you unnerstand, never. No matter what happens.
I stare at him.
I won't, I says. I ain't no quitter, Pa.
That's my girl.

Love so joyfully and freely given can never be taken away. It is never truly gone.

even 
in the loneliest moments
i have been there
for myself.

Love means never having to be apart

I think one of the sweetest lessons taught by the Prophet, and yet one of the saddest, occurred close to the time of his death. He was required to leave his plan and vision of the Rocky Mountains and give himself up to face a court of supposed justice.
These are his words: 'I am going like a lamb to the slaughter; but I am calm as a summer's morning; I have a conscience void of offense towards God, and towards all men' (D&C 135:4). That statement of the Prophet teaches us obedience to law and the importance of having a clear conscience toward God and toward our fellowmen. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught these principles--by example.
There was to be one great final lesson before his mortal life ended. He was incarcerated in Carthage Jail with his brother Hyrum, with John Taylor, and with Willard Richards. The angry mob stormed the jail; they came up the stairway, blasphemous in their cursing, heavily armed, and began to fire at will. Hyrum was hit and died. John Taylor took several balls of fire within his bosom. The Prophet Joseph, with his pistol in hand, was attempting to defend his life and that of his brethren, and yet he could tell from the pounding on the door that this mob would storm that door and would kill John Taylor and Willard Richards in an attempt to kill him.
And so his last great act here upon the earth was to leave the door and lead Willard Richards to safety, throw the gun on the floor, and go to the window, that they might see him, that the attention of this ruthless mob might be focused upon him rather than the others. Joseph Smith gave his life. Willard Richards was spared, and John Taylor recovered from his wounds.
'Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends' (John 15:13). The Prophet Joseph Smith taught us love--by example.

I want all my senses engaged. Let me absorb the world's variety and uniqueness.

The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quite alone with the heavens, nature and God.

I don't think anyone, until their soul leaves their body, is past the point of no return

Be patient and open-minded in your interactions with others; find the positive attributes that they possess.

Look in the mirror and say, 'There is none other like you and for that reason alone you are beautiful.

The Highest Thought is always that thought which contains joy. The Clearest Words are those words which contain truth. The Grandest Feeling is that feeling which you call love.

You can surrender without a prayer, but never really pray without surrender. You can fight without ever winning, but never ever win without a fight.

One word of encouragement can be enough to spark someoneâs motivation to continue with a difficult challenge.

So long as you do no harm to another, change your opinion once in a while. Contradict yourself without being embarrassed. This is your right. It doesn't matter what others think -because that's what they will think, in any case.

Cynicism is what passes for insight when courage is lacking.

To oppose something is to maintain it... You must go somewhere else; you must have another goal; then you walk a different road.

Orang yang tidak pernah dibakar panas mentari, mustahil menghargai rimbun berteduh - peribahasa Turki.

I asked her if I was black or white. She replied "You are a human being. Educate yourself or you'll be a nobody!

The walls are the publishers of the poor.

Helen Keller became deaf, dumb, and blind shortly after birth. Despite her greatest misfortune, she has written her name indelibly in the pages of the history of the great. Her entire life has served as evidence that no one is ever defeated until defeat has been accepted as reality.

Writing means not just staring ugliness in the face, but finding a way to embrace 
 it.

Living a life fully engaged and full of whimsy and the kind of things that love does is something most people plan to do, but along the way they just kind of forget. Their dreams become one of those "we'll go there next time" deferrals. The sad thing is, for many there is no "next time" because passing on the chance to cross over is an overall attitude toward life rather than a single decision.

Teach her that the idea of 'gender roles' is absolute nonsense. Do not ever tell her that she should or should not do something because she is a girl. 
'Because you are a girl' is never reason for anything. 
Ever.

Heaven help the roses if the bombs begin to fall

I suppose we'll never know what really happened in that room, though he did tell police, "I did it because I'm a dirty dog." This is not a very convincing alibi. He may as well have said, "I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one.

I find it odd- the greed of mankind. People only like you for as long as they perceive they can get what they want from you. Or for as long as they perceive you are who they want you to be. But I like people for all of their changing surprises, the thoughts in their heads, the warmth that changes to cold and the cold that changes to warmth... for being human. The rawness of being human delights me.

Don't look to the approval of others for your mental stability

Real courage is doing the right thing when nobody's looking. Doing the unpopular thing because it's what you believe, and the heck with everybody.

To accomplish great things, we must dream as well as act.

The day is ending. It's time for something that was beautiful to turn into something else that is beautiful. Now, Let go.

He who speaks without an attentive ear is mute.

I ask you right here please to agree with me that a scar is never ugly. That is what the scar makers want us to think. But you and I, we must make an agreement to defy them. We must see all scars as beauty. Okay? This will be our secret. Because take it from me, a scar does not form on the dying. A scar means,

Setiap kamu punya mimpi atau keinginan atau cita-cita,

Feel the fear and do it anyway!

We sinned for no reason but an incomprehensible lack of love, and He saved us for no reason but an incomprehensible excess of love.

Dislike in yourself what you dislike in others.

One day you will wake up & there wonât be any more time to do the things youâve always wanted. Do it now.

Believe it is possible to solve your problem. Tremendous things happen to the believer. So believe the answer will come. It will.

Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by doing that some have entertained angels without knowing it.

If you want to find happiness, find gratitude.

Life is a journey, not a destination; there are no mistakes, just chances we've taken.

Learn as if you were not reaching your goal and as though you were scared of missing it

Cautious, careful people, always casting about to preserve their reputation and social standing, never can bring about a reform. Those who are really in earnest must be willing to be anything or nothing in the world's estimation, and publicly and privately, in season and out, avow their sympathy with despised and persecuted ideas and their advocates, and bear the consequences...

Silk is a fine, delicate, soft, illuminating, beautiful substance. But you can never rip it! If a man takes this tender silk and attempts to tear it, and cannot tear it, is he in his right mind to say "This silk is fake! I thought it was soft, I thought it was delicate, but look, I cannot even tear it" ? Surely, this man is not in his right mind! The silk is not fake! This silk is 100% real. It's the man who is stupid!

One who has loved truly, can never lose entirely. Love is whimsical and temperamental. Its nature is ephemeral, and transitory. It comes when it pleases,and goes away without warning. Accept and enjoy it while it remains, but spend no time worrying about its departure. Worry will never bring it back.

If itâs going to be a world with no time for sentiment, itâs not a world that I want to live in.

After all, when you come right down to it, how many people speak the same language even when they speak the same language?

When you start giving, instead of getting, you make a difference. You can always give a warm smile, a sincere hello, a positive vibeâ¦ your attention, your time, your love, and kindness to those around you.

This is a love story. Twisted and messy. Flawed and screwed up. But it's ours. It's us. I don't know how our story will end. but I know it will start.

When you're locked up in here for life, you learn to welcome the little freedoms.

I have seen sights and travelled in countries you cannot imagine. I have been afraid and I have been in danger, and I have never for one moment thought that I would throw myself at at a man for his help.

It's what's in 
 that makes you happy or unhappy.

You are the perfect creation of God. Don't allow you to be down. God is experiencing through you.

Energy comes not from your muscle neither from your heart. It comes from your inner source.

When you were born you were crying and everyone else was smiling. Live your life so at the end, your're the one who is smiling and everyone else is crying.

You have two choices, to conquer your fear or to let your fear conquer you.

Of course, a sign doesn't mean anything unless you know how to interpret it.

If the stars should appear but one night every thousand years how man would marvel and adore.

What a wonderful life Iâve had! I only wish Iâd realized it sooner.

I was taught to strive not because there were any guarantees of success but because the act of striving is in itself the only way to keep faith with life.

By 20, you should be smart. By 30, you should be strong. By 40, you should be rich. By 50, you should be wise. But if you are smart, strong, rich and wise, you don't need any age limits.

When we fully understand the brevity of life, its fleeting joys and unavoidable pains; when we accept the facts that all men and women are approaching an inevitable doom: the consciousness of it should make us more kindly and considerate of each other. This feeling should make men and women use their best efforts to help their fellow travelers on the road, to make the path brighter and easier as we journey on. It should bring a closer kinship, a better understanding, and a deeper sympathy for the wayfarers who must live a common life and die a common death.

Deep down, I donât believe it takes any special talent for a person to lift himself off the ground and hover in the air. We all have it in usâevery man, woman, and childâand with enough hard work and concentration, every human being is capable ofâ¦the featâ¦.You must learn to stop being yourself. Thatâs where it begins, and everything else follows from that. You must let yourself evaporate. Let your muscles go limp, breathe until you feel your soul pouring out of you, and then shut your eyes. Thatâs how itâs done. The emptiness inside your body grows lighter than the air around you. Little by little, you begin to weigh less than nothing. You shut your eyes; you spread your arms; you let yourself evaporate. And then, little by little, you lift yourself off the ground.
Like so.

If we constantly focus only on the stones in our mortal path, we will
almost surely miss the beautiful flower or cool stream provided by the
loving Father who outlined our journey. Each day can bring more joy
than sorrow when our mortal and spiritual eyes are open to God's
goodness. Joy in the gospel is not something that begins only in the
next life. It is our privilege now, this very day. We must never allow
our burdens to obscure our blessings. There will always be more
blessings than burdens--even if some days it doesn't seem so. Jesus
said, "I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it
more abundantly." Enjoy those blessings right now. They are yours and
always will be.

I inherited this country when I was only a child, Nahuseresh. I have held it. I have fought down rebellious barons. I've fought Sounis to keep the land on this side of the mountains. I have killed men and watched them hang. I've seen them tortured to keep this country safe and 
. How did you think I did this if I was a fool with cow eyes for any handsome man with gold in his purse?

Live Long and Prosper

You don't have to be stupid to be a Christian, ... but it probably helps.

The world has enough women who know how to be smart. It needs women who are willing to be simple. The world has enough women who know how to be brilliant. It needs some who will be brave. The world has enough women who are popular. It needs more who are pure. We need women, and men, too, who would rather be morally right than socially correct.

Sometimes, there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day.

All men are created equal. It is what you do from there that makes the difference. We are all free agents in life. We make our own decisions. We control our own destiny.

Unless we have something worth dying for, Atretes, we've nothing worth living for.

You soak up my soul and mingle me. Each drop of my blood cries out to the earth. We are partners, blended as one.

There's always a choice,' said Torak, and walked backward off the cliff.

You can tempt me, desert me, or cause me great pain; you can create a dark world that my cause me to fear; you can rule your world with blood and terror, that's true.
But you can't win. And I know that. Weak as I am, with my imperfections and sins, even with all of my failing, I am stronger than you.
I will soon have a body. And I have my agency now. I will increase in my faith and knowledge and power. I am not perfect, but I will be, and there's not a thing you can do! I will become like the Father if I follow the Son. You are powerless to stop me. You can threaten and tempt and whisper lies in my ear, but you can't stop me, Satan; I see that so clearly now! I can stop myslef, yes, but only if I follow you.
And I reject you temptations. I reject your whispered lies. I reject you, Lucifer, and your entire plan. You have no power to control me. I am in control of myself. And try as you might, you won't control me on earth. We will defeat you in heaven, and we will deafeat you on earth. Here, or the earth, it doesn't matter; I am always stronger than you.

Stop in somebody's shadow to rest and cool down, and you are lost. No one can make anyone else happy.

Listen, God love everything you love - and a mess of stuff you don't. But more than anything else, God love admiration.
You saying God vain? I ast.
Naw, she say. Not vain, just wanting to share a good thing. I think it pisses God off if you walk by the color purple in a field somewhere and don't notice it.
What it do when it pissed off? I ast.
Oh, it make something else. People think pleasing God is all God care about. But any fool living in the world can see it always trying to please us back.

Naw, Jem. I think that there is just one kind of folks. Folks."
Jen turned and punched his pillow. WHen he settle back his face was cloudy. He was going in to one of his declines, and I grew wary. His brows came together; his mouth became a thin line. He was silent for a while. 
That is what I thought, too," he said at last, "when I was your age. If there is just one kind of folks, why can't they get along with each other? If they're all alike, why do they go ut of their way to despise each other? Scout, I think I am beginning to understand something. I think I'm beginning to understand why Boo Radley stayed shut up in the house all this time...it's because he wants to stay inside

When you've found another soul who see's in to your own...take good care of each other..and remember to be kind..

There are so many moments to remember and sometimes I think that maybe we're not really people at all. Maybe moments are what we are.... Sometimes I just survive. But sometimes I stand on the rooftop of my existence, arms stretched out, begging for more.

I looked about me. Luminous points glowed in the darkness. Cigarettes punctuated the humble meditations of worn old clerks. I heard them talking to one another in murmurs and whispers. They talked about illness, money, shabby domestic cares. And suddenly I had a vision of the face of destiny. Old bureaucrat, my comrade, it is not you who are to blame. No one ever helped you to escape. You, like a termite, built your peace by blocking up with cement every chink and cranny through which the light might pierce. You rolled yourself up into a ball in your genteel security, in routine, in the stifling conventions of provincial life, raising a modest rampart against the winds and the tides and the stars. You have chosen not to be perturbed by great problems, having trouble enough to forget your own fate as a man. You are not the dweller upon an errant planet and do not ask yourself questions to which there are no answers. Nobody grasped you by the shoulder while there was still time. Now the clay of which you were shaped has dried and hardened, and naught in you will ever awaken the sleeping musician, the poet, the astronomer that possibly inhabited you in the beginning.

Do you give the horse his strength or clothe his neck with a flowing mane? Do you make him leap like a locust, striking terror with his proud snorting? He paws fiercely, rejoicing in his strength, and charges into the fray. He laughs at fear, afraid of nothing; he does not shy away from the sword. The quiver rattles against his side, along with the flashing spear and lance. In frenzied excitement he eats up the ground; he cannot stand still when the trumpet sounds."
Job 39:19-25

sometimes we have absolutely no idea where we are, we need the smallest clue to show us where to begin.

Of course we're Christian. The very name of the church declares that. The more people see us and come to know us, the more I believe they will come to realize that we are trying to exemplify in our lives and in our living the great ideals which (Jesus Christ) taught.

Even if it's absurd to think you can change things, it's even more absurd to believe that it is foolish and unimportant to try.

Islam and Christianity promise eternal paradise to the faithful. And that is a powerful opiate, certainly, the hope of a better life to come. But there's a Sufi story that challenges the notion that people believe only because they need an opiate. Rabe'a al-Adiwiyah, a great woman saint of Sufism, was seem running through the streets of her hometown, Basra, carrying a torch in one hand and a bucket of water in the other. When someone asked her what she was doing, she answered, 'I am going to take this bucket of water and pour it on the flames of hell, and then I am going to use this torch to burn down the gates of paradise so that people will not love God for want of heaven of fear of hell, but because He is God.

Life is and will ever remain an equation incapable of solution, but it contains certain known factors.

Why are you being so mean?"
"Friends tell friends the truth."
"yeah, but not to hurt, to help.

My Creed
I do not choose to be a common man,
It is my right to be uncommon â¦ if I can,
I seek opportunity â¦ not security.
I do not wish to be a kept citizen.
Humbled and dulled by having the
State look after me.
I want to take the calculated risk;
To dream and to build.
To fail and to succeed.
I refuse to barter incentive for a dole;
I prefer the challenges of life
To the guaranteed existence;
The thrill of fulfillment
To the stale calm of Utopia.
I will not trade freedom for beneficence
Nor my dignity for a handout
I will never cower before any master
Nor bend to any threat.
It is my heritage to stand erect.
Proud and unafraid;
To think and act for myself,
To enjoy the benefit of my creations
And to face the world boldly and say:
This, with Godâs help, I have done
All this is what it means
To be an Entrepreneur.

You can't just wish change; you have to live the change in order for it to become a reality.

Actually, you can be bad at something...but if you love doing it, that will be enough. - August Boatwright

To those human beings who are of any concern to me I wish suffering, desolation, sickness, ill-treatment, indignitiesâI wish that they should not remain unfamiliar with profound self-contempt, the torture of self-mistrust, the wretchedness of the vanquished: I have no pity for them, because I wish them the only thing that can prove today whether one is worth anything or notâthat one endures.

All of the great empires of the future will be empires of the mind.

The bottom line is, insults only hurt when they come from someone I respect.

We could all do with a bit more joy in our lives couldn't we? The wonderful thing is that when we start spreading joy, we begin to actually experience more joy in our lives too!

Because saving the people you love isn't stupid. It isn't even a choice

Above all things physical, it is more important to be beautiful on the inside - to have a big hear and an open mind and a spectacular spleen.

We have been moving along at such a fast pace that we no longer know what we are doing. Now we have to wait until our soul catches up with us.

Often, moreover, it is...that aspect of our being that society finds eccentric, ridiculous, or disagreeable, that holds our sweet waters, our secret well of happiness, the key to our equanimity in malevolent climes.

There is something good in all seeming failures. You are not to see that now. Time will reveal it. Be patient.

Age is a very high price to pay for maturity.

The future belongs to God, and it is only he who reveals it, under extraordinary circumstances. How do I guess at the future? Based on the omens of the present. The secret is here in the present. If you pay attention to the present, you can improve upon it. And, if you improve on the present, what comes later will also be better. Forget about the future, and live ach day according to the teachings, confident that God loves his children. Each day, in itself, brings with it an eternity.

Those who have a strong sense of love and belonging have the courage to be imperfect.

It is not the possession of truth, but the success which attends the seeking after it, that enriches the seeker and brings happiness to him.

[The decay of Logic results from an] untroubled assumption that the particular is real and the universal is not.

cause when there's life there's still hope

It was time to let go of the mad desire to remember. It was time to start living whatever life would come. In the present, not the past.

Life is a barter of choice and consequences.

I Love Loving You
You are my favorite song; a rhythm of beauty that captures my spirit.
You are my favorite poem; an exquisite grouping of ideas set in motion with an unmatched enchanting elegance. 
You are my best friend; from our laughter to our deep conversations, our moments together are a timeless pleasure.
You are my soul mate; a connection so pure, so powerful, that it can only be considered divine. 
You are my lover; a passionate entwinement, a chorus of ecstasy, and a feeling of complete unity that words could never adequately describe.
You are my angel; you remind me of the goodness in this world and inspire me to be the greatest version of myself.
You are my home; it is in your loving gaze that I find the comfort, acceptance, and the sense of belonging. 
You are my love ~ mi amor; there are not enough days in forever to allow me to fully express my love for you.
I love loving you.

We would do ourselves a tremendous favor by letting go of the people who poison our spirit.

CLAUDIA: I love you as high as the sky and as deep as the sea.
MICHAEL: Multiply my love by infinity and take it to the depths of forever, and you still have only a glimpse of how much I feel for you. I love you more.

What others think about you is none of your business.

Sometimes you deal with the devil not because you want to, but because if you don't, someone else will.

Love never comes with a brochure of rules and regulations, a prospectus with guides of what is acceptable and what is abominable. Itâs a standard to follow your heart, and thatâs what I did and if doing that hurt you, then Iâm sorryâ¦ sorry for coming in your life and wasting your time, for causing you an anguish so great that you could not bear the sight of me. Today, I am proud to stand up and honour myself and proclaim to the worldâ¦ yes, I loved someone more than myself. I loved someone truly, madly, deeply!

Spirituality exist in testing and experiencing the depth of inner peace consistently.
